## 5.1 Legal Foundations: Current TOPA/COPA Landscape

### 5.1.1 NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902/902-A)

On the cusp of enactment, NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902, amended as Intro 902-A in December 2025) establishes the basic acquisition framework that TCAP will leverage (New York City Council, 2024; Matthews, 2025).

**Key Provisions of Intro 902-A:**(Matthews, 2025; New York City Council, 2024)

- **Covered Properties:** Four or more-unit buildings, or vacant lots that can accommodate four or more-unit buildings, plus buildings where affordability restrictions have expired or are set to expire within two years, including 421-a, 485-g, 485-x, and Affordable NY buildings (Matthews, 2025).

- **Notice & Timeline:**

  - Owner must provide written notice to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) at least 5 days before taking any action that would result in the sale of the property (Matthews, 2025).
  - Qualified entities have 45 days to submit a statement of interest in the property (New York City Council, 2024).
  - Qualified entities then have an exclusive 90-day period to submit a competitive offer to purchase (New York City Council, 2024).
  - During this exclusive period, owners cannot accept third-party offers (Matthews, 2025).

- **Right of First Refusal:** If a nonprofit's initial offer is rejected, the nonprofit retains a right of first refusal on any third-party offer received within one year; owner must notify HPD and the nonprofit within 15 days of receiving such an offer, and the nonprofit has 15 days to exercise its matching purchase right (Matthews, 2025).

- **Qualified Entities:** HPD will designate qualifying nonprofits, community land trusts, and other entities through rulemaking; currently includes NYC's designated Qualified Preservation Buyers, plus emerging community land trusts and cooperative sponsors (New York City Community Land Initiative, 2024).

**TCAP Integration Point:**
TCAP cooperatives and their sponsoring nonprofits will be explicitly recognized in HPD's "Qualified Entity" rulemaking under Intro 902-A, allowing tenant associations and TCAP-ready cooperatives to receive first-purchase rights. This positions TCAP as a natural vehicle for COPA acquisitions, rather than as a separate legal track (New York City Council, 2024; New York City Community Land Initiative, 2024).

## 5.2 TCAP Core Statutory Codification: Local Law A (REVISED)

### 5.2.1 Title, Purpose, and Definitions

**Proposed Local Law A: Public Equity Transfer Framework for Affordable Housing**

**Purpose Statement (§ 26-1801):**

"The purpose of this chapter is to:

(a) Establish a permanent program to convert rental housing subsidies into resident-owner equity and democratic control through limited-equity cooperative ownership;

(b) Create pathways for extremely low-income households (at or below 50% of Area Median Income) to accumulate wealth and achieve housing stability;

(c) Preserve permanently affordable housing and prevent displacement by placing buildings under democratic resident control;

(d) Close the racial wealth gap in housing by directing equity benefits to Black, Latino, and other communities of color disproportionately affected by displacement and housing insecurity;

(e) Integrate subsidy-to-equity conversion with NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902-A) and New York State's Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (S.401) to create a comprehensive acquisition and ownership pathway for resident-controlled housing."

**Definitions (§ 26-1802):**

- **"TCAP Cooperative"** or **"Tenant-Controlled Equity Cooperative"**: A limited-equity housing cooperative, organized under New York Cooperative Law § 1801–2000, that has adopted TCAP affordability covenants and equity-account structures and is designated by HPD as meeting TCAP program standards.

- **"Resident-Owner"**: An individual shareholder in a TCAP cooperative who has completed resident-owner certification and income verification and holds an equity account within the cooperative. Resident-owners occupy a unit and have voting rights in cooperative governance.

- **"Qualified Entity"**: A nonprofit organization, community land trust, or resident-owner-controlled cooperative designated by HPD as meeting criteria for acquiring property under Intro 902 COPA and converting it to TCAP cooperative ownership within a defined timeframe (typically 24–36 months post-closing).

- **"Resident-Owner Equity Account"**: An individual resident-owner's ownership stake in the cooperative, funded by subsidy redirection (20% of monthly housing subsidy), the resident-owner's share of mortgage principal paydown, and any initial down-payment contribution; equity is non-forfeitable and inheritable.

- **"Carrying Charge"**: The resident-owner's monthly housing payment in a TCAP cooperative, including rent/occupancy fees, operating costs, and debt service; capped at 15% of the resident-owner's verified household income per § 26-1804.

- **"TCAP Affordability Covenant"**: A 30-year deed restriction, recorded on the property, requiring that all units remain permanently affordable to households at or below specified income limits, carrying charges do not exceed 15% of resident-owner household income, resident-owner resale rights are governed by an affordability-preserving formula, and no unit may be converted to market rate without HPD and City Council approval.

- **"Area Median Income" (AMI)**: As calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the New York City metropolitan area, adjusted for family size; 50% AMI is the primary target for resident-owner eligibility.

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.2.2 Subsidy Conversion and Resident-Owner Equity Mandates (§§ 26-1803 to 26-1806)

**Subsidy Allocation (§ 26-1803):**

"When any housing subsidy, including but not limited to subsidies under the CityFHEPS (Housing Choice Voucher) program or equivalent rental assistance programs administered by DSS, is assigned or allocated to a TCAP cooperative, DSS and HPD shall ensure that:

(a) **Minimum Equity Allocation**: At least 20% of the monthly subsidy amount shall be credited directly to individual resident-owner equity accounts monthly. As of the enactment of this chapter, for a subsidy of $1,800/month, this mandate establishes a minimum of $360/month ($4,320/year) in resident-owner equity credits.

(b) **Carrying Charge Coverage**: At least 50% and not more than 70% of the monthly subsidy shall be applied to the cooperative's carrying charge (building operating costs, debt service, maintenance, administration).

(c) **Reserve Requirement**: The remainder (10–30%) may be retained by the cooperative as a capital reserve, subject to periodic audit and resident-owner approval of reserve targets.

(d) **Inflation Indexing**: The total subsidy amount shall be adjusted annually, effective April 1 of each year, using the percentage change in the New York City Rent Guidelines Board's Preferred Index of Operating Costs (PIOC), or if PIOC is discontinued, the Consumer Price Index for the New York City metropolitan area, to ensure adequacy of carrying charge coverage and maintenance of the 15% resident-owner affordability cap."

**Resident-Owner Affordability Cap (§ 26-1804):**

"(a) **15% Income Cap**: No TCAP resident-owner shall be required to pay a carrying charge exceeding 15% of their verified household income in any month. This affordability cap is enforceable, non-waivable, and shall be maintained in perpetuity or for so long as the resident-owner remains a cooperative shareholder.

(b) **Income Growth Exception**: If a resident-owner's income grows to exceed 80% of Area Median Income, the resident-owner's carrying charge may increase to not more than 20% of income, provided that HPD and DSS jointly determine that such increase does not undermine the resident-owner's ability to maintain equity account accumulation.

(c) **Hardship Accommodation**: Resident-owners facing temporary income loss or hardship may request a subsidy adjustment or short-term carrying charge reduction, to be reviewed by the cooperative board and HPD; any approved reduction shall not forfeit or reduce the resident-owner's equity credits.

(d) **Enforcement**: HPD shall monitor resident-owner carrying charges annually; any cooperative charging above the 15% cap shall be subject to compliance order per § 26-1808."

**Resident-Owner Equity Account Structure (§ 26-1805):**

"(a) **Establishment**: Upon resident-owner certification and admission to a TCAP cooperative, each resident-owner shall have an individual equity account established and registered with the cooperative and HPD, showing opening balance and monthly accretion.

(b) **Funding Sources**:

- (1) Subsidy redirection: 20% of monthly housing subsidy (minimum $360/month for a $1,800 subsidy).
- (2) Principal paydown: Resident-owner's pro-rata share of cooperative mortgage principal paid down monthly.
- (3) Initial contribution: Resident-owner's down-payment contribution at entry, typically $8,000 per resident-owner, funded via savings match and subsidy advance.

(c) **Ownership**: The equity account is the property of the individual resident-owner. The cooperative holds it in trust and may not pledge it to secure cooperative debt.

(d) **Non-Forfeiture**: Equity shall not be forfeited upon resident-owner's departure, voluntary withdrawal, or death; resident-owner or heir shall receive equity upon exit or by inheritance.

(e) **Quarterly Reporting**: Cooperatives shall provide quarterly equity statements to each resident-owner showing opening balance, monthly credits, current balance, and year-end projected balance; information shall be provided in English and other languages spoken by 10%+ of resident-owners.

(f) **Annual Verification**: HPD shall verify equity accounting annually through independent audit."

______________________________________________________________________

## 5.3 Affordability Covenant and Duration (§§ 26-1807 to 26-1809) (REVISED)

**TCAP Affordability Covenant (§ 26-1807):**

"(a) **Recordation and Binding Effect**: Every TCAP cooperative property shall have a TCAP Affordability Covenant recorded as a deed restriction on the property, running with the land in perpetuity or for a minimum of 30 years, binding current and future cooperative resident-owners, boards, and any successor entity.

(b) **Covenant Terms**: The covenant shall provide that:

- (1) All units in the building shall be and remain permanently affordable, serving households at or below 50% of Area Median Income (or, for households initially income-eligible at entry, at adjusted affordability levels for households earning up to 80% AMI).
- (2) Carrying charges shall not exceed 15% of resident-owner household income, indexed annually.
- (3) Resident-owner resale rights shall be governed by an HPD-approved formula limiting resident-owner sales to formula prices (typically 90–110% of original resident-owner purchase price adjusted for inflation), preventing speculation while allowing moderate appreciation.
- (4) No unit may be converted to market-rate occupancy, sold to a non-resident-owner, or removed from affordability without HPD and City Council approval.
- (5) Democratic governance structures (resident-owner assembly voting, board representation, annual meetings) shall be maintained in perpetuity."

______________________________________________________________________

## 5.4 Resident-Owner Rights and Protections (§ 26-1810 to 26-1812) (REVISED)

**Residency and Ownership Rights (§ 26-1810):**

"(a) **Right to Occupy**: Each resident-owner has an exclusive, non-revocable right to occupy their cooperative unit for the duration of their ownership, subject only to payment of carrying charges (capped at 15% of income) and compliance with cooperative rules and lease terms.

(b) **Voting Rights**: Each resident-owner-shareholder shall have one vote per share (typically one share per unit) in cooperative decisions, including annual board election, budget approval, carrying charge adjustment, major repairs, bylaw amendments (typically requiring two-thirds supermajority), and dissolution (typically requiring 75–80% supermajority).

(c) **Information Rights**: Resident-owners may inspect cooperative financial records, resident roster, board minutes, and building inspection reports at reasonable hours; information shall be provided in English and other languages spoken by 10%+ of resident-owners.

(d) **Participation Rights**: Resident-owners shall participate in board committees, training sessions, and governance decisions; the cooperative shall facilitate meaningful participation through flexible scheduling, language access, and childcare support."

**Anti-Retaliation Protections (§ 26-1811) (REVISED):**

"(a) **Prohibited Retaliation**: A cooperative, its board, or any officer shall not retaliate against a resident-owner for:

- (1) Asserting or enforcing resident-owner rights under this chapter or cooperative bylaws.
- (2) Requesting carrying charge reduction for hardship.
- (3) Reporting building code violations to DOB or HPD.
- (4) Voting in board elections or advocating for board changes.
- (5) Requesting financial information or transparency.
- (6) Organizing resident-owners for governance changes or advocacy.
- (7) Filing a complaint with HPD, the Commission on Human Rights, or other agency.

(b) **Presumption of Retaliation**: If a resident-owner is evicted, assessed a special charge, or subject to other adverse action within 90 days of asserting a protected right, a rebuttable presumption of retaliation arises.

(c) **Remedies**: A resident-owner subjected to retaliation shall be entitled to reversal of the adverse action, actual damages (including lost carrying charge credits and legal fees), attorney's fees and court costs, and punitive damages if retaliation was willful."

## 5.5 Federal and State Funding Alignment (Key Sections)

### 5.5.1 HUD Moving to Work (MTW) Waiver Strategy

**MTW Program Leveraging:** (Gramlich, 2025; HUD Exchange, 2020)

"HPD and NYC may seek designation as a MTW expansion agency to obtain flexibility in deploying federal housing subsidies, including:

(a) **Subsidy Fungibility**: Using freed-up subsidy dollars to fund TCAP cooperative acquisitions and resident-owner equity contributions (Gramlich, 2025).

(b) **Flexible Payment Standards**: Setting payment standards for CityFHEPS in TCAP cooperatives based on cooperative carrying-charge needs rather than market rents, ensuring adequacy of the 80/20 subsidy split (HUD Exchange, 2020).

(c) **Direct-to-Cooperative Payments**: Structuring subsidy payments to flow directly to the cooperative's account for processing per the 80/20 equity split (HUD Exchange, 2020)."
