# Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework

## Two-Page Briefing Memo – v2025-12-17

______________________________________________________________________

**TO:** Deputy Mayor for Housing, HPD Commissioner, HRA Administrator, NYC Comptroller\
**FROM:** NYC Housing Equity Investment Reform Project\
**DATE:** December 17, 2025\
**SUBJECT:** Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework – Policy Options, ROI, & Recommendation

______________________________________________________________________

## Problem Summary

NYC allocates **$4–5B annually** to rental subsidies (CityFHEPS, FHEPS, Section 8, emergency vouchers) for ~300,000 households. These programs prevent immediate eviction but generate **zero resident wealth**, zero permanent housing security, and zero intergenerational stability.

**Outcomes:** 95,000+ evictions annually; 64,000 persons in city shelter; $3B+ annual shelter cost; record youth homelessness (154,000 school students in 2023–24).

**Root issue:** Subsidies pay landlords, not residents. Households accumulate zero equity. City absorbs perpetual maintenance costs (shelter, legal services, emergency rent) without building permanent solutions.

______________________________________________________________________

## Three Policy Options

### **Option 1: Status Quo (Pure Rental Subsidy Continuation)**

- Continue CityFHEPS, FHEPS, Section 8 as-is.
- **Pros:** Administratively simple; no governance changes; familiar to HRA/DSS staff.
- **Cons:** Perpetual eviction/shelter cycle; zero wealth building; federal subsidy vulnerability (repeat cuts); no permanent affordability.
- **10-year city cost (Pilot 1 scale):** $7.4M (subsidies + shelter diversion).
- **Household wealth after 10 years:** $0.
- **Recommendation:** **Not viable.** Perpetuates current crisis.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Option 2: ANCP Expansion (Mixed-Income Cooperatives)**

- Scale ANCP: convert more TIL buildings to mixed-income cooperatives (low-income TIL tenants + moderate-income cooperators, 100–120% AMI).
- **Pros:** Builds some resident ownership; rehabs distressed buildings.
- **Cons:** High reliance on federal Section 8 subsidies (60–80% of maintenance costs); moderate-income members may resist affordability controls; complex governance; TIL residents become minority owners; ANCP history shows slow, contentious rollout; perpetuity not guaranteed post-tax-abatement.
- **10-year city cost (Pilot 1 scale, assuming $1.5–2M/year):** $15–20M (subsidy + rehab + governance support).
- **Household equity (low-income members):** Modest ($5–10k from $2,500 buy-in appreciation, if any).
- **Federal subsidy dependency:** HIGH (60–80% of maintenance).
- **Recommendation:** **Improvable but limited.** Mixed-income structure creates equity tensions; federal subsidy exposure too high.

______________________________________________________________________

### **Option 3: Public Equity Transfer (PET) – RECOMMENDED**

- Redirect 20–30% of existing CityFHEPS payment into resident equity accounts within resident-controlled cooperatives or CLTs.
- Households pay same monthly rent; city subsidy split: 70% → rent, 30% → equity accrual.
- **Pros:**
  - **Budget-neutral:** No new appropriation; redirects existing subsidy.
  - **Permanent affordability:** Article XI low-income deed restrictions in perpetuity.
  - **Resident control:** Cooperative boards manage buildings; members have votes.
  - **High equity accrual:** $28,800–43,200 per household over 10 years (heritable at controlled prices).
  - **Eviction prevention:** Residents with equity stake + cooperative collective action reduce evictions 60–80%.
  - **Federal subsidy resilience:** Cap reliance ≤50% of debt; PET Emergency Reserve Fund buffers cuts.
  - **Legal precedent:** Article XI framework proven; minimal statutory changes needed.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires HRA/HPD operational integration (payment-routing system change).
  - Tenant-board governance requires pre-conversion training (8–12 weeks).
  - Article XI perpetuity means members cannot capture full market-rate appreciation (controlled-appreciation model).
- **10-year city cost (Pilot 1 scale):** $5.6M (same subsidy outlay, redirected + admin overhead), **minus $500k shelter diversion = $5.1M net**. **Net savings vs. status quo: $2.3M over decade.**
- **Household equity:** $28,800–43,200 per household; heritable to children at Article XI controlled prices.
- **Federal subsidy dependency:** LOW–MEDIUM (capped ≤50%).
- **Recommendation:** **ADOPT.** Highest ROI, lowest risk, permanent solution.

## Equity & Distributional Impact

**PET targets:**

- Low-income households (≤100% AMI; priority ≤80% AMI).
- DSS/Homebase caseload (~70% Black, 20% Latino, 5% Asian, 5% other; ~60% single-parent).
- Priority buildings: existing organized tenant associations (TIL/HDFC) with governance capacity.

**Equity outcomes:**

- **Eviction prevention:** 80% reduction (5 evictions → 1 eviction per 60-household cohort over 10 years).
- **Wealth accrual:** Median $28,800 per household; $1,728,000 aggregate (pilot); heritable at controlled low-income prices.
- **Racial equity:** Mandatory disaggregated reporting; initial pilot targets neighborhoods with highest concentration of households served by CityFHEPS/DSS (predominantly low-income communities of color).
- **Intergenerational:** Children of PET members inherit cooperative shares at Article XI-controlled prices (~$50–150k depending on building), creating permanent family asset.

______________________________________________________________________

## Legal Feasibility & Risks

**Legal status:** **FEASIBLE** with minor administrative changes.

**Statutory basis:**

- NY PHFL Article XI (HDFC cooperatives with perpetual low-income purpose) – **NO CHANGE NEEDED.**
- NYC Admin Code § 11–112 (HPD authority over in rem property) – **Interpretation adjustment** to permit equity-investment redirection.
- HRA CityFHEPS (NYC Admin Code § 21–403) – **Reinterpretation** to permit payment split (70% rent, 30% equity).
- NYDFS Banking Law § 130 (credit-union lending) – **Guidance letter** confirming community development mission includes PET member lending.

**Principal risks (with mitigations):**

1. **Federal subsidy cut (HIGH severity, MEDIUM likelihood):** Cap reliance ≤50% of debt; establish $10–20M PET Emergency Reserve Fund; stress-test annually. **Mitigation cost: ~$2–3M seed fund.**
1. **Tenant governance failure (MEDIUM severity, MEDIUM likelihood):** 8–12 week pre-conversion training; HPD on-site coordinator; Right-to-Counsel support for all members. **Mitigation cost: ~$200k per pilot cohort.**
1. **Article XI perpetuity (wealth ceiling) (MEDIUM severity, LOW likelihood):** Transparent disclosure; controlled-appreciation framing; successor buyout pathways. **Mitigation cost: disclosure design, ~$50k.**
1. **Racial equity disparate impact (MEDIUM severity, MEDIUM likelihood):** Mandatory equity impact statement; stratified random pilot selection; disaggregated annual reporting. **Mitigation cost: civil-rights analysis, ~$100k/year.**

| **Pilot 2 (contingent)**  | 2027                   | ANCP replacement; 200–300 households                       | Annual review + scale decision         |

______________________________________________________________________

## Recommendation

**ADOPT OPTION 3 (PET) as the city's primary housing equity strategy, with Pilot 1 launch in Q2 2026.**

**Rationale:**

1. **Fiscal:** Highest ROI ($1.9M net savings over decade, Pilot 1 scale; $90M scaled to 5,000 households). Budget-neutral (redirects existing subsidy).
1. **Equity:** Permanent wealth building ($25k–$50k per household); intergenerational inheritance; eviction prevention.
1. **Governance:** Resident control (cooperative boards); civil-rights protections (equity impact statements, Right-to-Counsel, Title VI/ADA/504 compliance).
1. **Legal:** Operationally sound under Article XI; minimal statutory changes (NYC Code amendment). Strong legal precedent (40 years of HDFC cooperatives in NYC).
1. **Implementation:** Fast-tracked 90-day approval pathway (Phase I–IV) enables Q2 2026 Pilot 1 launch.

______________________________________________________________________

## Decision Asks

1. **Mayoral:** Endorse PET framework; authorize Phase II research; support statutory amendment (if needed) for City Council introduction.
1. **HPD/HRA:** Designate PET Coordinator + HRA liaison; authorize IT scoping for payment-routing system.
1. **CFO/OMB:** Confirm budget neutrality; audit-readiness for ROI model.
1. **Tenant orgs / Legal services / Credit unions:** Co-design Pilot 1; finalize partnership MOUs by Phase III, Week 7.
