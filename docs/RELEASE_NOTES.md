# Release notes / Changelog

## v1.0-consolidated-2 (2025-12-30)

- ✅ Normalized section filenames in `docs/sections/housing-policy-framework` (renamed ambiguous index-style files to descriptive filenames and fixed non-breaking-space filename issues). See merged PRs and history for details.
- ✅ Fixed and merged low-risk documentation fixes (Mimura DOI correction; Clark & Ledwith DOI annotated as [Paywalled]). See PR #97.

## Ongoing (2026-01-06)

- Performed a refined repository link-check that strips code fences and inline code: scanned 176 Markdown files, found 145 unique external links, with 49 flagged failures. Full log: `logs/link-check/link-check-2026-01-06T220717Z.json`.
- Next actions: triage external failures (classify as replaceable, annotate-only, or remove), add Wayback snapshots where applicable, and open small PRs for clear fixes. See Issue #96 for tracking.
