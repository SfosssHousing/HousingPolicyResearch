# APA Citation Style Guide (7th Edition)

This document establishes the house citation standards for the Housing Policy Research project based on APA 7th edition guidelines.

> **Note:** This file should ideally be located at `/docs/citations/STYLE-APA.md` once directory creation is supported.

## Overview

All citations in this repository must follow APA 7th edition format to ensure:
- **Consistency**: Uniform presentation across all documentation
- **Traceability**: Clear provenance for policy recommendations
- **Reproducibility**: Verifiable sources for research claims
- **Professionalism**: Standards-compliant documentation for stakeholders

## General Citation Principles

### Core Components
Every citation should include, where applicable:
1. **Author(s)** – Individual(s), organization(s), or government agency
2. **Publication date** – Year (and month/day if applicable)
3. **Title** – Document or article title in sentence case
4. **Source** – Journal, publisher, or platform
5. **Persistent identifier** – DOI, ISBN, or stable URL

### Format Priority
When multiple identifiers exist, prioritize in this order:
1. **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier) – Always format as `https://doi.org/xxxxx`
2. **Stable URL** – Archival or official agency URL
3. **ISBN** – Only record in notes field for tracking; not included in APA reference

## Special Considerations

### Paywalled Sources
When citing paywalled academic journals or reports:
1. Include the full citation with DOI
2. Add a note: `[Paywalled]` after the URL
3. Provide a 2-3 sentence summary in the annotation
4. Link to any publicly available working paper version if it exists

**Example:**
```
Rothwell, J., & Massey, D. S. (2010). Density zoning and class segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas. Social Science Quarterly, 91(5), 1123-1143. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6237.2010.00724.x [Paywalled]
```

**Accessible summary:** Analyzes how minimum lot size requirements correlate with economic segregation across U.S. metros. Finds that restrictive density regulations significantly reduce socioeconomic diversity.

### Superseded or Dated Sources
When citing older studies or guidelines that may have been updated:
1. Include the original citation with date
2. Add a note: `[Superseded by: New Citation]` or `[Data current as of YYYY]`
3. Flag for periodic review in the verification notes

**Example:**
```
Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. (2019). The state of the nation's housing 2019. https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2019 [Data current as of 2018; see 2023 edition for latest]
```

### Secondary Sources
When citing a secondary source (not ideal, but sometimes necessary):
1. Include both original and secondary source in the reference
2. Use this format in-text: (Original Author, year, as cited in Secondary Author, year)
3. Add a note explaining why the primary source was inaccessible

**Format:**
```
Original Author, A. A. (Year). Title of original work. Secondary Author, B. B. (Year). Title of secondary work. Publisher. URL
```

**Note:** Prefer primary sources. Use secondary citations only when the original is unavailable or in a language you cannot translate.

## In-Text Citations

### Basic Format
- **Single author:** (Smith, 2020)
- **Two authors:** (Smith & Jones, 2020)
- **Three or more authors:** (Smith et al., 2020)
- **Organization:** (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2021)
  - Subsequent citations: (HUD, 2021) if abbreviation is well-known

### Direct Quotations
Include page or paragraph numbers:
- (Smith, 2020, p. 45)
- (Jones et al., 2021, para. 3)

### Multiple Works
Separate with semicolons, alphabetically:
- (Glaeser & Gyourko, 2018; Schuetz, 2020)

## Annotation Requirements

Each resource entry in the resources index and CSV must include:

1. **Relevance** (1 sentence): Why this source matters for housing policy research
2. **Application** (1 sentence): How it supports or limits the proposal
3. **Quality flags** (optional):
   - `[Primary source]` – Original research or government data
   - `[Secondary analysis]` – Review or synthesis of other works
   - `[Advocacy]` – Position paper from stakeholder group
   - `[Paywalled]` – Access requires subscription
   - `[Dated]` – Data or guidance may be superseded

## Verification Protocol

Before adding a citation to the index:

1. **Confirm accessibility**: Test DOI or URL; flag dead links
2. **Verify metadata**: Check author, title, date against the original source
3. **Assess quality**: Primary vs. secondary; peer-reviewed vs. gray literature
4. **Check currency**: Note publication date; flag if >5 years old for data-driven sources
5. **Record context**: In what section(s) of the proposal is this source used?

Document verification steps in the "Verification notes" section of resource entries.

## Prohibited Practices

❌ **Do not:**
- Invent citations or fabricate sources
- Copy citations from secondary sources without verification
- Use broken or redirected URLs without noting the issue
- Cite personal communications without permission
- Include ISBNs in the reference list (APA 7th does not require them)

✅ **Do:**
- Verify every citation against the original source
- Use persistent identifiers (DOI) whenever available
- Flag uncertainties with TODO comments in draft PRs
- Preserve the original citation trail when using secondary sources
- Update citations when new editions or data releases become available

## Maintenance and Updates

This style guide will be reviewed:
- **Quarterly** – To incorporate new source types encountered in research
- **When APA releases updates** – To align with official guidance changes
- **As needed** – When citation issues or inconsistencies are identified

Changes to this guide require:
1. A pull request with rationale
2. Review by the project lead or designated librarian
3. Update to affected citations in the resources index
