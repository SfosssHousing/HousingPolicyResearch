# Tenant Toolkit: Navigating Housing Subsidies and Rights

## Introduction

This toolkit provides a concise guide for tenants in New York City who rely on housing subsidies. It summarises your rights, responsibilities and resources, drawing from national policy guidance and tenant protection toolkits. Use it as a printable reference when applying for subsidies, dealing with landlords or advocating for fair housing.

## Understanding Housing Subsidies

Housing subsidies help bridge the gap between what tenants can afford and market rents. Programs such as Section 8 vouchers and city-based rental assistance pay a portion of your rent directly to landlords. However, subsidies often come with administrative requirements like income recertification and reporting household changes. Failure to comply can lead to sudden rent adjustments or even loss of assistance ([Now Available: Four New Tenant Protection Toolkits!](https://nlihc.org/resource/now-available-four-new-tenant-protection-toolkits#:~:text=Now%20Available%3A%20Four%20New%20Tenant,than%20300%20new%20tenant%20protections)).

### How to Apply or Recertify

- Gather documentation: proof of income, identification, lease and household composition.
- Submit applications or recertification forms to the appropriate housing authority by deadlines.
- Report changes in income or household members promptly to avoid penalties.
- Keep copies of all correspondence and receipts for your records.

## Tenant Protections

Even with subsidies, tenants are vulnerable to rent hikes and eviction if proper protections are not in place. The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) toolkits emphasize the importance of rent stabilization, just‑cause eviction standards, caps on late fees and penalties for illegal lockouts ([Now Available: Four New Tenant Protection Toolkits!](https://nlihc.org/resource/now-available-four-new-tenant-protection-toolkits#:~:text=Now%20Available%3A%20Four%20New%20Tenant,than%20300%20new%20tenant%20protections)). Without these protections, landlords may raise rents faster than subsidies can keep up or evict tenants without fair cause.

Key protections to advocate for:

- **Rent stabilization:** limits annual rent increases and ties them to inflation.
- **Just‑cause eviction:** landlords must show a valid reason (e.g., non‑payment of rent or serious lease violations) before evicting a tenant.
- **Fee limits:** caps on late fees and application fees.
- **Anti‑lockout protections:** penalties for landlords who change locks or shut off utilities without a court order.

## Habitability and Code Enforcement

Housing providers receiving subsidies must maintain safe and habitable units. The NLIHC Code Enforcement and Habitability Standards toolkit urges proactive inspections and adequate funding for repairs, especially for small landlords ([Code Enforcement and Habitability Standards Toolkit](https://nlihc.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/SLI_Code_Enforcement_Toolkit.pdf#:~:text=Code%20Enforcement%20and%20Habitability%20Standards,inform%20the%20material%20presented%20in)). Tenants should know their right to request inspections and to withhold rent in extreme cases if habitability standards are not met (consult legal counsel before withholding rent).

Steps to ensure habitability:

1. Document problems (e.g., leaks, mold, pests) with photos and written complaints to your landlord.
1. If repairs are not made within a reasonable time, contact 311 to request a Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) inspection.
1. Keep copies of correspondence and inspection reports.
1. If unsafe conditions persist, seek legal assistance through tenant advocacy organizations.

## Equity and Inclusion

Subsidy programs must address historical inequities rooted in segregation and discrimination. A trauma‑informed and critical‑whiteness framework recognizes how policies have disproportionately harmed communities of color. When advocating for reforms, highlight the need to prioritize marginalized tenants, provide language access services, and ensure that reforms do not perpetuate racial disparities.
