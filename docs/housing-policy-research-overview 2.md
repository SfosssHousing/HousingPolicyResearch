# Housing Policy Research Environment Setup

This document records the secure configuration for the HousingPolicyResearch
GitHub repository in a macOS 26.1 / iOS 26.1 environment while ensuring the job
application automation stays confined to the Reminders-focused `JobApplications`
workspace.  Nothing in this setup modifies or links to other repositories
automatically; integrations with ChatGPT, Codex, Notion, GitHub, and Zotero are
coordinated through documented workflows instead.

## Directory Layout

| Location                                                             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `$HOME/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/JobApplications` | Primary workspace synced to iCloud for capturing job postings, drafts, and reminder CSV exports.  Subfolders `Applications/`, `Reference/`, and `Reminders/` keep files decluttered. |
| `$HOME/Documents/GitHub/JobApplications`                             | Local Git clone dedicated solely to job applications with the same subfolder layout.                                                                                                 |
| `.../JobApplications/Reminders/job_application_reminders.csv`        | Reminders template generated by `job_app_manager` for import into Reminders/Numbers without touching other tools.                                                                    |

Create or refresh these directories by running:

```bash
python -m chatgpt_notion_sync.job_app_manager --job-data path/to/jobs.json \
    --profile path/to/profile.json
```

## Reminders-Focused Job Application Flow

- Run `python -m chatgpt_notion_sync.job_app_manager --job-data jobs.json` to
  populate the `Reminders/` directories.  Optional `--profile` inputs only affect
  the match percentage calculation.
- Import `job_application_reminders.csv` into Reminders on macOS 26.1 or iOS
  26.1, configure list notifications, and pin views that show `due_soon` or
  `overdue` rows.
- Review the `attention_summary` column first—it lists each incomplete
  component and highlights urgent deadlines so focus stays on unfinished tasks.
- Store working drafts in `Applications/` and supporting research in
  `Reference/` so the workspace remains decluttered when syncing between devices.

## Secure Knowledge System Connections

The broader HousingPolicyResearch environment still coordinates with external
knowledge systems, but the job automation is not dependent on those services.

| Direction              | Exchange Method                                                                                                                   | Reverse Link                                                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatGPT/Codex → GitHub | Export prompt transcripts as Markdown files inside `JobApplications/Reference/notes/`.                                            | Commit hashes referenced inside ChatGPT session summaries.              |
| GitHub → Notion        | Separate Notion workspace ingests published research digests (not job reminders) via manual uploads signed with the `.env` token. | Notion comments link back to Git commit hashes for verification.        |
| Notion → Zotero        | Zotero item keys stored in the Notion database `tags` property enable citation reconciliation.                                    | Zotero notes include the Notion page URL for provenance.                |
| Zotero → ChatGPT/Codex | Export citation metadata to JSON near the relevant `jobs.json` entries so ChatGPT can ground summaries.                           | ChatGPT output references the Zotero key to make reconciliation easier. |

Security controls:

- Tokens for Notion, GitHub, and Zotero live in `~/.config/housing_policy/.env`
  with permissions `600`.  Scripts read them via environment variables only.
- The Reminders CSV is generated in both iCloud and GitHub copies to maintain an
  encrypted backup without syncing unrelated repositories.
- When onboarding a new device, clone `JobApplications` fresh, run the CLI once
  to rehydrate the CSV, and manually re-authorize the Notion/Zotero connections
  used for research work.

## Error Corrections and Validation

- The job automation now resolves the GitHub repository path safely even when
  the environment variable already points to the `JobApplications` directory,
  preventing accidental creation of nested repositories.
- Documentation explicitly states that no other repositories are touched,
  aligning with compliance requirements.

## Next-Step Task Breakdown

1. **Catalog outstanding postings** – append missing entries to
   `jobs.json`, including prerequisites and file links for each listing.
1. **Enrich profile data** – expand `profile.json` with detailed skills,
   education history, and interest statements to improve match scoring.
1. **Re-run automation** – execute `python -m chatgpt_notion_sync.job_app_manager`
   so both JobApplications directories receive the refreshed CSV.
1. **Reminders focus review** – verify the `attention_summary` column matches the
   Reminders smart lists so incomplete work stays surfaced.
1. **Security review** – rotate API tokens quarterly, verify the `.env`
   permissions remain `600` on every synced device, and keep Notion/Zotero
   automations segregated from the job workflow.
