# Section 7: Implementation Roadmap, Success Metrics & Evaluation Framework

## Implementation Roadmap (90‑Day Launch Plan)

Implementation of the Tenant Co‑op Acquisition Program begins with a structured 90‑day roadmap that establishes the foundations for a pilot.  Each phase has clear deliverables, timelines and budget allocations【597013538936435†L406-L444】.

## Agency Implementation & Operations Plan

Beyond the initial 90‑day launch, TCAP requires sustained operational capacity to certify properties, support tenant associations, manage equity accounts and enforce affordability covenants.  Key elements include:

- **Establish a Dedicated TCAP Unit within HPD:** Staffed by a director, senior policy analyst, cooperative development specialists, financial underwriters and compliance officers (14–15 FTEs) to oversee program execution, interagency coordination, underwriting and compliance monitoring.  Funding for this unit is estimated at **$2–3 million per year** (operations budget referenced in the briefing memo).

- **Develop a Tenant Equity Fund (TEF):** A municipal trust that receives diverted subsidy funds, manages individual equity accounts, provides acquisition financing and reserves, and contracts with credit unions for account administration.

- **Standardise Procedures:** Develop manuals and templates for property identification and eligibility screening, tenant association certification, subsidy conversion processing, acquisition financing, title transfer, post‑acquisition oversight, and annual audits.  Utilize the **Agency Implementation Guide** and operations workplans to align staff roles and timelines.

- **Technology Infrastructure:** Build or procure a platform to track monthly equity allocations, generate statements for tenants, and integrate data from HPD, NYCHA, HRA and credit union partners.

- **Training & Capacity Building:** Provide training for agency staff, tenant leaders and cooperative boards on cooperative governance, financial management, legal compliance and data reporting.  Use the Advocacy Toolkit’s educational modules and tenant‑organizing resources.

- **Interagency Coordination:** Formalize collaboration agreements between HPD, NYCHA, HRA and other relevant agencies to ensure seamless data sharing, legal compliance and budgeting.  Establish regular joint meetings and define decision‑making protocols.

## Success Metrics & Evaluation Framework

Evaluation of TCAP’s effectiveness will track both long‑term outcomes and early process indicators.  Key metrics include【597013538936435†L450-L470】:

| **Racial equity outcomes** | -- | **≥ 60 % Black/Latino participation** | **≥ 60 % Black/Latino participation** | Ensures equitable access and participation across demographics【597013538936435†L461-L462】 |

### Early Process Metrics

- **Enrollment Rate:** At least **80 %** of eligible tenants opt in within 18 months【597013538936435†L466-L467】.
- **Equity Allocation Accuracy:** Achieve **≥ 99 %** accuracy in monthly equity allocations (audit verified)【597013538936435†L466-L469】.
- **Default Rate:** Keep tenant default rates under **10 %** by year 5, monitored quarterly【597013538936435†L469-L470】.
- **Tenant Satisfaction:** Maintain a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of **50** or higher through quarterly surveys【597013538936435†L469-L470】.

### Evaluation Methods

- **Performance Dashboard:** Publish regular updates on outcome and process metrics to a public dashboard.  Track progress toward targets and enable real‑time course corrections.

- **Annual Reports:** Produce annual reports detailing financial performance, equity accumulation, demographic participation, and compliance outcomes.  Include independent audits and evaluations by academic or research partners.

- **Third‑Party Evaluation:** Commission external evaluations every three years to validate methodology, examine unintended consequences, and provide recommendations for improvement.

## Conclusion

A disciplined implementation roadmap and robust evaluation framework will ensure that TCAP launches efficiently, scales responsibly and delivers on its promises of wealth building, affordability and equity.  Transparent metrics and adaptive management will allow city leaders and stakeholders to monitor progress, identify challenges and refine program design as the initiative grows from pilot to citywide program.
