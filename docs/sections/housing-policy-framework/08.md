# Section 8 – Equity, Anti‑Displacement & Governance Safeguards

## 8.1 Equity & Racial Justice Imperative

New York City’s housing crisis is inseparable from its racial wealth gap.\
Historical redlining, exclusionary lending and discriminatory voucher rules mean the
homeownership rate for white households (≈44 %) is vastly higher than for Black (≈27 %) and Latino (≈17 %)
households【936499250569345†L46-L50】.  These disparities translate directly into
intergenerational wealth differences; renters accumulate almost no equity while homeowners build
family assets.  TCAP’s Public Equity Transfer Framework (PETF) was therefore designed to directly
address racial injustice by converting long‑term rental subsidies into co‑ownership stakes.\
Through PETF, qualified voucher recipients can form a **shared limited‑equity cooperative** (SLEC) and
receive a municipally backed equity grant to acquire their building.  Tenants start with a
50/50 equity split with the City and, as they pay \`\`equity rent’’, the tenant share increases to
65/35 and then 75/25 to build generational wealth【936499250569345†L81-L87】.  The policy’s stated
objectives explicitly include **closing the racial homeownership gap by 4–6 percentage points,
generating roughly US$64 million in intergenerational tenant wealth and achieving a 2.9:1 ROI
within ten years**【936499250569345†L93-L96】.  To hold the programme accountable, outcome metrics
track wealth accumulation per tenant (baseline US$0; US$15 000 at year 3; US$75 000 at year 10),
increases in homeownership rates (0 % baseline; 5–8 % after three years; 20–30 % after ten years)
and the share of participating households who are Black or Latino (goal ≥60 %)【597013538936435†L452-L462】.

## 8.2 Anti‑Displacement & Fair Housing Measures

A central design feature of TCAP/PETF is **anti‑displacement**.  Instead of simply offering
subsidies, PETF gives tenants a right of **first refusal** to purchase their building once an owner
declines to renew a rental assistance contract.  Buildings that enter the programme are placed
into a **community land trust (CLT)**; land remains permanently under non‑profit stewardship, while
residents own a limited‑equity interest in their homes.  Affordability covenants and resale
restrictions ensure units remain perpetually affordable; owners receive a modest, indexed return
on resale but cannot speculate on land value.  The TCAP legislative package further mandates
**tenant‑owner and municipal transfer contracts** that specify purchase price formulas, allowable
rent/fee increases, resale caps and perpetual affordability provisions.

The policy’s outreach targets historically redlined neighbourhoods and ensures that immigrant,
minority and disabled residents receive priority admission.  All programme materials are made
available in multiple languages and the implementation team works with trusted community
organisations to reduce barriers to entry.

Compliance with civil rights and fair housing law is non‑negotiable.  PETF must be implemented in
a manner consistent with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (prohibiting discrimination on the basis
of race or national origin) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (guaranteeing access for
people with disabilities).  Fair housing screens ban discrimination based on race, gender, sexual
orientation, immigration status or family composition.  Building plans require accessibility
retrofits, and the programme provides additional grants for reasonable accommodations.  Process
metrics measure enrolment (target 80 %+ within eighteen months) and track default rates (\<10 %)
and tenant satisfaction (Net Promoter Score ≥50)【597013538936435†L466-L470】.

## 8.3 Cooperative Governance & Democratic Control

TCAP housing is governed through **Shared Limited‑Equity Cooperatives (SLECs)**, which enshrine
democratic control and community accountability.  Each household receives **one vote**, regardless
of unit size or capital contribution.  SLEC boards comprise tenant‑owners, a municipal
designee and an independent expert (such as a non‑profit housing provider).  Major decisions—such
as refinancing, changes to fee structures, or disposition of property—require supermajority
approval.  Board members must complete training in cooperative governance, fair housing, fiscal
management and conflict resolution.  Annual general meetings review budgets, capital reserve
balances, maintenance plans and compliance with affordability covenants; meeting minutes and
financial statements are published online to promote transparency.

The SLEC law (Local Law B) establishes an **Office of Cooperative Governance** within the
Department of Housing Preservation and Development to provide technical assistance, mediate
conflicts and monitor compliance.  The Office has authority to appoint a temporary receiver if a
cooperative fails to meet financial obligations or violates equity caps.  An independent
**Oversight Board**, including representatives from tenant advocacy organisations, civil rights
experts and municipal finance officials, reviews programme performance annually and makes
recommendations to the City Council.  Metrics such as cooperative reserve sufficiency, board
turnover and compliance with audit requirements feed into the broader evaluation framework.

## 8.4 Anti‑Speculation & Accountability Measures

Because the PETF model creates a novel asset class, the legislation incorporates safeguards
against speculation and corruption.  Shares in SLECs vest over a ten‑year period; early exit
triggers **repurchase by the CLT** at the initial investment plus a modest equity appreciation
factor.  Equity payout formulas cap annual appreciation at **CPI + 2 %** to prevent windfall gains.
The City retains a **residual interest** in every SLEC and can exercise a right of reversion if
affordability covenants are violated.  Oversight audits examine sales and refinancing to detect
straw purchasers or predatory equity investors.  A municipal reserve fund buffers against
property market downturns and can purchase troubled units to keep them in perpetual affordability
【597013538936435†L474-L506】.

Transparency and accountability are reinforced by reporting requirements: the Office of
Cooperative Governance publishes annual performance reports, the programme’s fiscal impacts and
racial equity outcomes are tracked publicly, and all contracts, covenants and audit reports are
subject to Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) disclosure.  Tenants may file grievances through an
independent ombudsperson.  These mechanisms ensure PETF remains mission‑driven and advances
racial justice rather than becoming a vehicle for speculation.
