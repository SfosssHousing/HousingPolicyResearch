# Section 1: Executive Summary & Core Problem Definition

## Overview

New York City invests more than **$3.9–5 billion per year** on rental subsidies such as Section 8 vouchers, CityFHEPS and public‐housing operations, serving over **400 000 households**【597013538936435†L15-L21】【644586308190714†L3-L8】.  Despite this outlay, subsidy recipients build **no asset wealth**; tenants remain perpetual renters while public dollars generate wealth for landlords【597013538936435†L15-L21】.  This perpetual expense cycle perpetuates intergenerational inequality and widens racial homeownership disparities.

## Core Problem

- **Perpetual Expense with No Equity Return.**  Existing subsidy programs pay the difference between tenant contributions (30–40 % of income) and contract rent, leaving tenants without any equity accumulation【597013538936435†L75-L79】.  Subsidy dollars never return to the municipal budget and do not create intergenerational wealth【597013538936435†L81-L85】.

- **Fiscal Strain and Housing Instability.**  NYCHA faces a **$78 billion capital deficit**, and rent‑to‑income ratios have climbed to **55 %**—far above the 30 % affordability benchmark【597013538936435†L15-L21】.  Emergency shelter and eviction costs continue to rise because the system stabilizes landlords rather than households.

- **Structural Inequity.**  Decades of redlining, credit discrimination and restrictive federal voucher rules have entrenched racial disparities.  Homeownership rates show a **17–27 percentage‑point gap** between Black, Latino and white households (NYU Furman Center 2021–2024).  Without a mechanism for renters to build assets, public subsidies reinforce wealth inequality rather than mitigate it.

## Proposed Paradigm: Public Equity Transfer / Tenant Equity Vehicles

The **Public Equity Transfer Framework (PET)** and pilot **Tenant Co‑op Acquisition Program (TCAP)** repurpose existing housing subsidies into **Tenant Equity Vehicles (TEVs)**.  Rather than treating subsidies as permanent rent payments, a portion of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is allocated to individual equity accounts.  Tenants continue to pay roughly 30 % of income toward housing, but the city redirects **$200–$400 per month** from existing subsidies into an equity stake【597013538936435†L24-L35】.  Over a 15‑year period these contributions allow tenants to purchase their homes under shared‑equity or limited‑equity cooperative structures, while affordability protections such as community land trusts or deed restrictions prevent speculation【597013538936435†L24-L35】.

### Key Benefits

1. **Asset Building & Wealth Transfer.**  Tenants accumulate **2–4 % wealth each year** (approximately **$1 700–$2 100 annually**)【597013538936435†L30-L34】 and can amass about **$45 000 in equity over 15 years**, creating a path for intergenerational wealth.

2. **Budget Neutrality with Return.**  The program reallocates existing subsidy budgets rather than requiring new spending; modelling projects a **5–8 % annual fiscal return** through appreciation and tenant buy‑outs【597013538936435†L24-L35】.  A 10 000‑unit pilot could generate **$450 million in tenant equity** and **$2 billion in property appreciation** at no additional cost.

3. **Affordability Lock & Legal Compliance.**  Shared‑equity ground leases and community land trusts ensure permanent affordability, while the model operates within federal and state housing laws such as Section 8(y) homeownership options, Section 504, Title VI, the Fair Housing Act and the NY Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act【597013538936435†L34-L37】.

4. **Enhanced Housing Stability & Equity.**  By converting renters into **member (tenant‑owners)**, TCAP reduces eviction risk and enhances community control.  A five‑year pilot could reduce eviction filings by **40 %** and save **$6 600 per unit** compared with current subsidies【644586308190714†L19-L49】.

### Execution Roadmap

A 90‑day startup roadmap outlines baseline mapping, financial modelling, stakeholder validation, legal review and final report delivery【597013538936435†L39-L44】.  After legislative authority and HUD waivers are secured, the city can implement a **10 000‑unit pilot** using NYCHA PACT units, expand to **20 000+ units** through CLT partnerships and ultimately scale city‑wide.
