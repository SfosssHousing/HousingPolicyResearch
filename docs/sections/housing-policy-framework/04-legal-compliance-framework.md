# Section 4: Legal & Compliance Framework

## Federal Statutory Anchors

| Statute                                                                            | Applicability                                                                                                                      | Compliance Notes                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Section 8(y) Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Option**                       | Authorises Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) for homeownership; TEVs can leverage this precedent      | Tenant must be a first‑time homebuyer (can be waived for Section 8 tenants); risk is low if TEV remains an option rather than a mandate                                          |
| **Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act**                                          | Governs programs using federal funds; requires reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities | TCAP must adjust equity accrual schedules and provide modified payment options for disabled tenants; no significant new burden beyond standard Section 504 compliance            |
| **Title VI of the Civil Rights Act**                                               | Prohibits disparate impact discrimination for programs targeting low‑income populations               | TCAP must collect and monitor demographic data; pair with race‑equity briefing and inclusive enrollment strategies to avoid discrimination; design must be facially race‑neutral |
| **Fair Housing Act (FHA) & Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act (HOTMA)** | Covers familial status, disability, national origin and other protected classes                       | Standard FHA/HOTMA procedures apply; risk is low if eligibility criteria are neutral and outreach is inclusive                                                                   |

## New York State Legal Considerations

- **Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA, 2019).**  Rent‑stabilized units cannot increase rents by more than 3 % annually; TEV equity contributions could be mischaracterized as rent.  Mitigation involves clearly separating equity allocations from rent, maintaining tenant payment at 30 % of income and amending the New York Housing Finance Law to authorise municipal equity vehicles.

- **New York Cooperative Board Law (2022).**  Governs limited‑equity co‑ops; co‑ops are exempt from HSTPA rent controls and may enforce financial underwriting standards (maintenance fees, application fees).  This structure can reduce administrative burdens compared with shared‑equity homeownership.

- **Real Property Tax Law & Other Provisions.**  TEV ownership raises questions about property tax treatment.  The risk matrix identifies medium risk; the city must clarify whether TEVs qualify for owner or renter tax exemptions.  Additional state amendments may be needed to recognise equity‑based subsidies.

## Municipal Legislation

TCAP implementation requires four complementary local laws:

1. **Public Equity Transfer Framework (Local Law A).**  Establishes the legal mechanism to redirect subsidies into convertible equity instruments; defines eligibility criteria, tenant associations, limited‑equity cooperatives and the cooperative acquisition process.  It sets phase‑in allocations (50/50 → 65/35 → 75/25) for equity vs. carrying charges and authorises the creation of a **Tenant Opportunity Fund** for acquisition financing, reserve accounts and technical assistance (see Local Law A for details).

1. **Subsidized Limited‑Equity Cooperative Classification (Local Law B).**  Creates a regulatory regime for subsidized limited‑equity cooperatives (SLECs), codifying affordability covenants, reserve requirements, audit obligations and democratic governance (one‑household‑one‑vote).  It ensures that resale price formulas preserve long‑term affordability and that cooperatives maintain transparency and accountability.

1. **Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Rights Expansion (Local Law C).**  Extends right‑of‑first‑refusal provisions to buildings with high subsidy density; provides 90‑day notice to tenants before sale; enforces matching rights and anti‑retaliation protections; and aligns financing and technical assistance with the PET framework.

1. **TCAP Implementation & Oversight (Local Law D).**  Establishes a multi‑agency Task Force (HPD, HRA, NYCHA, community representatives, CDFIs, legal advocates) to oversee the pilot, certify tenant associations, approve technical assistance providers, conduct annual reviews and produce public reports.  It authorises a dedicated TCAP unit within HPD and mandates data transparency and evaluation periods.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

The legal risk matrix identifies potential challenges and corresponding strategies:

| Domain                          | Risk Level | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Section 8 authority**         | **Low**    | Use HUD’s 2000 ruling and Section 8(y) precedent; maintain TEVs as an option rather than a mandate                                                                    |
| **Title VI/FHA compliance**     | **Medium** | Conduct racial equity analysis, ensure inclusive outreach and enrollment, monitor disparate impacts and adjust program design                                         |
| **HSTPA compliance**            | **High**   | Amend state law to clarify that municipal equity allocations are not rent; explicitly separate tenant payments from equity contributions |
| **Section 504 accessibility**   | **Low**    | Implement standard disability accommodations and payment adjustments                                                                     |
| **Real Property Tax treatment** | **Medium** | Seek statutory clarification on tax status of TEV units to ensure affordability and avoid unintended tax burdens                                                      |

## Recommended Legal Instruments

To operationalise TCAP, the following instruments are recommended:

1. **Municipal Ordinance:** Authorise the HPD Commissioner to establish a **Tenant Equity Fund (TEF)** as a municipal trust, pilot 10 000 units and manage equity accounts.

1. **State Legislation:** Amend the New York Housing Finance Law to permit equity‑based subsidy conversions and cross‑reference Section 8(y) and HOTMA.

1. **Contract Amendments:** Revise HPD term sheets and NYCHA master leases to permit TEV payouts to tenants.

1. **Tenant Agreements:** Develop plain‑language disclosure forms that explain equity accrual, purchase options, CLT restrictions and tenant rights.

1. **CLT Partnership Memoranda:** Where community land trusts are involved, execute agreements detailing data sharing, revenue splits and stewardship responsibilities.

## Compliance & Oversight Structure

The TCAP legal framework embeds compliance through multiple mechanisms:

- **Regulatory Oversight:** HPD, HRA and NYCHA collaborate on certification, training, auditing and enforcement.  Annual compliance reports track financial performance, governance activities and adherence to affordability covenants.

- **Transparency & Accountability:** Public reporting requirements and open databases allow stakeholders to monitor program performance.  The Task Force includes tenant, community and CDFI representatives to ensure diverse oversight.

- **Adaptive Rulemaking:** The program anticipates modifications as it scales; authority is built in for HPD to adjust subsidy allocations, eligibility criteria, training requirements and partnership structures through rulemaking, subject to Council review.

## Conclusion

Legal analysis confirms that the PET/TCAP model is **feasible within existing federal and state frameworks** provided that the city adopts specific enabling legislation and secures targeted statutory amendments.  The combination of federal homeownership precedents, state cooperative law and new local laws creates a robust legal foundation for converting subsidies into equity.  The principal outstanding risk—clarifying that equity allocations are distinct from rent under HSTPA—can be addressed through state amendments and clear program design.  With these safeguards, TCAP complies with civil rights, fair housing and disability laws while advancing a transformative model for housing justice.
