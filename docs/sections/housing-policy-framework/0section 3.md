# Section 3 – How PET Works: Transfer Mechanism & Operations

The PET model transforms the flow of public housing subsidies into an equity‑building pathway.  This
section outlines the mechanism and operational workflows that turn a standard voucher into a
co‑ownership opportunity.

## 3.1 Transfer Mechanism

1. **Subsidy Split:** When a household is enrolled in PET, the city splits the monthly housing
   subsidy (e.g. CityFHEPS) into two streams: roughly **70 %** continues to pay rent/maintenance to
   the cooperative or CLT, and **30 %** goes into a **restricted equity account** managed by HPD on
   behalf of the household.  This split is codified in the equity‑share agreement and can be
   adjusted in future pilots (e.g. 65/35 or 75/25) without increasing total subsidy.
1. **Household Contribution:** The tenant continues to pay their traditional share (about 30 %)
   of monthly housing costs.  Their out‑of‑pocket expense does not change—only the destination of
   the public subsidy changes.
1. **Equity Accrual & Vesting:** Each equity deposit vests over a defined period (e.g. five
   years), ensuring that residents remain invested in the property and discouraging quick flip
   scenarios.  Equity accumulates monthly and is tracked through HPD’s equity management system.
1. **Exit & Resale:** After the vesting period, households may use their accrued equity to
   purchase a full cooperative share, remain as partial equity holders, or transfer their
   restricted share to heirs.  Resale prices are governed by Article XI controlled‑appreciation
   formulas to maintain affordability.

## 3.2 Household Journey from Intake to Ownership

PET participation follows a structured path that integrates existing DSS/HPD workflows with new
processes:

1. **Intake & Eligibility Screening:** Households at risk of eviction or in rental assistance
   programmes are referred to PET through **Homebase**, **CityFHEPS**, or **Right‑to‑Counsel**.  To
   qualify, households must have incomes ≤100 % of the Area Median Income (AMI), a stable
   rent‑payment history, and willingness to transition to cooperative or CLT ownership.  Case
   managers collect income verification, lease documents and consent forms and enter the data into
   the **PET Eligibility Dashboard**.
1. **Underwriting & Building Assignment:** HPD’s PET underwriting team (or a partner credit
   union) reviews income, credit history, debt‑to‑income ratios and eviction records.  There is no
   strict FICO minimum; the focus is on stability and ability to meet a 30 % rent burden.
   Approved households are matched to an available cooperative or CLT unit within an active
   pilot cohort.  Building readiness is essential: only properties with trained tenant boards
   and completed governance bylaws can accept new PET households.
1. **Equity‑Share Agreement & Legal Execution:** A Right‑to‑Counsel attorney and credit‑union
   representative prepare a **PET equity‑share agreement**.  This document specifies the subsidy
   split, vesting schedule, default remedies, succession rights and any loan terms.  Household
   members (18+) sign the agreement in their preferred language, alongside cooperative bylaws or
   CLT lease, ensuring informed consent.  HPD retains original documents and establishes the
   equity account.
1. **Payment Flows & Subsidy Administration:** Once the agreement is in place, HRA’s payment
   system automatically splits the monthly CityFHEPS payment: 70 % goes to the cooperative’s
   bank account for rent and 30 % goes to HPD’s equity account for the household.  The tenant
   pays their portion directly to the cooperative.  HPD produces monthly statements showing
   equity accrual and sends them to the household and cooperative board, promoting transparency.
1. **Cooperative Governance & Ongoing Support:** Resident boards manage the building under
   one‑member‑one‑vote rules.  HPD provides a **PET Coordinator** to support cooperatives,
   mediate disputes and monitor compliance.  Partner credit unions may underwrite maintenance
   loans; Right‑to‑Counsel attorneys remain available for legal questions.  If a household falls
   behind on its payments, case managers intervene early (within 5–15 days) to arrange payment
   plans or emergency assistance and avoid default.
1. **Exit, Succession & Expansion:** After five to ten years, households may convert their
   partial equity into a full cooperative share or continue to hold restricted equity while
   renting.  Shares vest gradually, meaning that departing households cannot extract the full
   balance immediately; instead, the cooperative or CLT repurchases the share at the controlled
   price and reassigns it to a new PET participant.  Building cohorts can expand as additional
   units become PET‑eligible, using the same governance and payment architecture.

## 3.3 Voluntary vs. Mandatory Adoption

PET is designed to be **voluntary** for both tenants and property owners.  Tenant associations
vote to opt in, and households choose to participate.  Property owners (including
TIL/HDFC buildings and private landlords) can elect to convert if they meet the pilot criteria.
However, the programme includes **right‑of‑first‑refusal provisions** that allow tenant
associations and the city to pre‑empt sales to outside investors, ensuring that buildings where
public subsidies have been invested are offered first to PET cooperatives.  In future phases,
the city may consider mandatory conversions for properties that consistently depend on
subsidies and meet specific conditions (e.g. long‑term arrears, code violations), subject to
legal feasibility.
