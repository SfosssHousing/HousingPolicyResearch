# Section 2 – PET Solution Overview

## What PET Does

The Public Equity Transfer (PET) framework reimagines rental assistance as an investment in
households rather than a perpetual subsidy to landlords.  Instead of sending 100 % of the
CityFHEPS or FHEPS payment to property owners, PET redirects a **portion of existing subsidies** into
**resident equity accounts**.  Under a standard pilot model:

- **Payment Split:** The city continues to cover roughly **70 %** of a household’s monthly housing
  cost, but now the payment is divided: 70 % flows to the **resident‑controlled cooperative or
  community land trust (CLT)** as rent/maintenance, and **30 % is deposited into a restricted
  equity account** in the household’s name.
- **Same Rent Burden:** The household pays its traditional 30 % share of the rent out of pocket;
  total monthly outlay remains unchanged from the existing voucher model.
- **Equity Accrual:** Each month’s equity deposit builds an ownership stake.  Over ten years, the
  average PET household will accumulate **US$28 000–43 000** in equity—wealth that can be used
  as a down payment to purchase the cooperative share or passed on to heirs under controlled
  appreciation rules.
- **No New Net Cost:** Because PET reallocates existing subsidy streams rather than adding new
  budgetary outlays, it is fiscally neutral.  Municipal costs remain stable while families build
  assets.

This simple change in cash flow transforms a tenancy into a pathway to ownership.  Households
enter PET through familiar channels (Homebase intake, CityFHEPS enrollment, Right‑to‑Counsel
referral), sign an **equity‑share agreement** with HPD and a credit union, and are matched to a
cooperative or CLT unit.  Payments are routed automatically: HRA splits the subsidy, HPD manages
household equity accounts, and credit unions underwrite any supplemental loans.  The framework
works within existing Article XI cooperative law and requires only minor amendments to the NYC
Administrative Code to authorise equity redirection and clarify HRA’s payment‑split authority.

## Core Benefits

PET unlocks multiple advantages relative to the status quo:

- **Diversified Public Revenue:** By creating a public equity stake in residential assets,
  government can capture a share of the appreciation that arises from public investments in
  infrastructure and neighbourhood amenities.  This revenue supplements property taxes and
  reduces reliance on volatile federal subsidies.
- **Long‑Term Wealth Building:** Tenants who have historically been renters now build net worth.  A
  household that accumulates US$30 000 in equity over a decade can use that capital to secure a
  mortgage, finance education, or pass wealth to children.  This directly addresses the racial
  wealth gap, where white households enjoy a 44 % homeownership rate while Black and Latino
  households lag far behind【936499250569345†L46-L50】.
- **Permanent Affordability:** Units converted through PET are structured as **limited‑equity
  cooperatives** or placed in CLTs with **Article XI** affordability covenants.  Resale prices
  are controlled, preventing windfall speculation and ensuring that housing remains affordable for
  future generations.
- **Resident Control and Democratic Governance:** Cooperatives formed under PET employ a
  one‑member‑one‑vote governance structure.  Boards are elected from among the resident‑owners
  and are accountable to them.  This empowers tenants to manage their buildings and align
  operations with community needs.
- **Eviction Prevention and Housing Stability:** Households with an ownership stake are more likely
  to invest in their homes and less likely to default.  PET households also benefit from
  continued **Right‑to‑Counsel** representation and emergency support funds, reducing eviction
  rates and shelter entries.
- **Intergenerational Equity:** Controlled‑appreciation shares can be inherited, enabling wealth
  transfers across generations.  Combined with Article XI restrictions, this ensures that
  inherited assets remain affordable and mission‑driven.

## Historical Precedents

While PET is innovative for New York’s housing sector, it draws inspiration from successful public
asset models around the world.  The **Alaska Permanent Fund**, **Norwegian Government Pension
Fund** and **Singapore’s Temasek Holdings** all leverage public ownership of natural resources or
state‑owned enterprises to generate dividends for citizens.  These precedents demonstrate that
public equity stakes can deliver both fiscal sustainability and broad social benefits when managed
transparently and insulated from political interference.  PET applies similar principles to the
housing sector: converting public spending into equity, managing assets through independent
cooperatives or trusts, and reinvesting returns in community wellbeing.

## Fiscal Impact & Scaling

Analyses of PET pilots show that the model is **cost‑neutral in the early years and cost‑positive
thereafter**.  For example, a pilot cohort of **60 households**, redirecting **US$1.8 million
annually** in subsidy, yields **net city savings of about US$1 million over ten years** due to
avoided shelter and legal costs.  At scale (5 000 households), PET could save tens of millions
while building more than **US$150 million in aggregate household equity**.  The city breaks even
within roughly **seven years** and achieves a positive ROI thereafter.  These fiscal dynamics
reinforce that PET is not only equitable but also an efficient reallocation of public resources.
