# Section 6: Alternatives Analysis

## Introduction

Before committing to the Public Equity Transfer (PET) framework, policymakers considered several alternative strategies for addressing New York City’s housing affordability and wealth gap.  This section compares these options—ranging from enhanced subsidies to voucher homeownership and community land trust funds—against the PET model.  Each alternative is summarised with its approach, fiscal impact, political feasibility and equity outcome【597013538936435†L349-L403】.

## Option A – Enhanced Subsidy (Status Quo)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Approach** | Increase HPD and NYCHA subsidy budgets by 20–30% to improve affordability targeting【597013538936435†L349-L352】 |
| **Cost** | Additional **$800 million–$1.2 billion per year**【597013538936435†L349-L353】 |
| **ROI** | **Negative** – perpetuates subsidy expenditures without generating tenant equity【597013538936435†L349-L355】 |
| **Political feasibility** | Moderate – some fiscal opponents; easier to pass than structural reform【597013538936435†L349-L355】 |
| **Equity outcome** | Minimal – more units served, but no wealth‑building for tenants【597013538936435†L349-L355】 |
| **Assessment** | Insufficient; fails to address intergenerational equity or budget sustainability【597013538936435†L357-L358】 |

## Option B – Section 8(y) Homeownership Expansion

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Approach** | Scale up NYCHA’s Section 8 homeownership option; provide mortgage financing and down payment assistance for 10 000 tenants【597013538936435†L360-L364】 |
| **Cost** | **$500 million–$700 million** in new capital for down payments and credit coaching【597013538936435†L360-L364】 |
| **ROI** | **Moderate** – tenants build equity after purchase, but requires upfront liquidity; benefits limited to credit‑ready participants【597013538936435†L364-L368】 |
| **Political feasibility** | High – built on federal precedent and existing authority【597013538936435†L366-L367】 |
| **Equity outcome** | Strong – homeownership creates wealth, but excludes lowest‑income households (< 30 % AMI)【597013538936435†L367-L370】 |
| **Assessment** | Valuable complementary strategy; should be piloted in parallel but cannot reach the poorest renters【597013538936435†L369-L370】 |

## Option C – Community Land Trust Acquisition Fund

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Approach** | Allocate **$500 million–$1 billion** in municipal capital to community land trusts (CLTs) to acquire and hold affordable properties, with ground leases to current tenants【597013538936435†L372-L375】 |
| **Cost** | **$500 million–$1 billion** upfront appropriation (not reallocation)【597013538936435†L372-L375】 |
| **ROI** | Positive – appreciation and lease revenue provide returns; permanent affordability ensures long‑term benefit【597013538936435†L376-L379】 |
| **Political feasibility** | Low – requires large new capital allocation competing with other priorities【597013538936435†L376-L379】 |
| **Equity outcome** | Strong – preserves affordability and creates shared equity【597013538936435†L379-L381】 |
| **Assessment** | Powerful complementary strategy; not viable as a standalone solution because of capital constraints【597013538936435†L380-L381】 |

## Option D – PACT Optimisation (RAD Expansion)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Approach** | Accelerate NYCHA’s Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD)/PACT conversions to 62 000 units by 2030; use RAD revenue gains for capital repairs【597013538936435†L383-L387】 |
| **Cost** | Neutral – relies on reallocation of existing Section 8 funding【597013538936435†L384-L387】 |
| **ROI** | Moderate – yields $200–$300 million in operational savings but does not generate tenant equity【597013538936435†L387-L392】 |
| **Political feasibility** | Moderate – union and tenant concerns about privatisation; may face opposition【597013538936435†L388-L390】 |
| **Equity outcome** | Weak – improves management and repairs but transfers ownership without wealth‑building【597013538936435†L391-L392】 |
| **Assessment** | Necessary incremental reform; should be layered with PET framework to produce equity gains【597013538936435†L393-L394】 |

## Option E – Public Equity Transfer (PET) / Tenant Co‑op Acquisition Program (TCAP)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Approach** | Reallocate 25 % of existing Housing Assistance Payments into equity vehicles while maintaining tenant payments at 30 % of income; pair with PACT conversions and CLT partnerships【597013538936435†L396-L402】 |
| **Cost** | **Budget‑neutral** – no new spending; redirects subsidy flows from rent to equity【597013538936435†L396-L402】 |
| **ROI** | High – projects positive net present value ($850 million–$1.2 billion for a 10 000‑unit pilot) and generates $2.45 billion in total tenant wealth and property appreciation【597013538936435†L396-L402】 |
| **Political feasibility** | Moderate to high – requires enabling legislation but aligns with fiscal prudence; can garner support from equity advocates and budget hawks alike |
| **Equity outcome** | Transformative – builds tenant wealth, locks in affordability through CLT and deed restrictions, and narrows racial homeownership gaps【597013538936435†L396-L402】 |
| **Assessment** | Recommended.  Combines existing subsidy reallocation with RAD/PACT infrastructure; scalable to 50 000+ units; integrates Section 8(y) homeownership for credit‑ready tenants and CLT partnerships for long‑term affordability【597013538936435†L396-L402】 |

## Comparative Summary

The alternatives illustrate that simply expanding existing subsidies or voucher homeownership programs provides limited gains and often requires significant new funding.  Community land trusts offer permanent affordability but demand large upfront capital.  PACT optimisation improves housing operations but does not address wealth‑building.  In contrast, the PET/TCAP model converts existing rental subsidies into equity at no additional cost, produces substantial financial returns and permanently locks in affordability through co‑ownership structures.  It can be layered with complementary strategies—such as Section 8(y) homeownership expansion and community land trust acquisition funds—to maximise impact across income groups.

## Conclusion

The Public Equity Transfer framework is the most cost‑effective and equitable solution among the options analysed.  While options B through D offer complementary pathways and should be pursued in tandem to reach different cohorts and housing types, they cannot by themselves transform the city’s subsidy system.  PET/TCAP stands out by creating wealth for low‑income tenants, preserving affordability, remaining budget‑neutral and leveraging existing legal authorities and pilot programmes.  Policymakers are therefore advised to adopt the PET framework as the core strategy and integrate select elements of the other options where beneficial.
