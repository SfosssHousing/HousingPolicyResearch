# Section 1 – Problem Statement

## Market Failures & Wealth Concentration

Public subsidies for housing are intended to prevent homelessness, yet they seldom alter the
underlying distribution of wealth.  New York City spends **US$4–5 billion every year** on rental
assistance programmes such as CityFHEPS, FHEPS and Section 8, supporting roughly **300,000 low‑income
households**.  This outlay stabilises tenants in the short term, but the funds flow directly to
landlords rather than residents; households remain renters without assets or economic security.
Meanwhile, property wealth accumulates in private hands, and the gap between owners and renters
widens【936499250569345†L46-L50】.  In a city where the homeownership rate for white households is
about **44 %**, compared with **27 % for Black households** and **17 % for Latino households**【936499250569345†L46-L50】,
subsidies that maintain the status quo reinforce entrenched racial disparities.

## Public Revenue Challenges

Traditional tax mechanisms and fee structures have not kept pace with rising housing costs.
Municipal budgets face pressure from spiralling shelter expenses, legal services, and emergency
rental assistance.  Subsidies are paid from general revenues without generating a return; there is
no asset created on the public balance sheet.  Federal funding streams are unpredictable, and
reliance on HUD’s Section 8 programme exposes the city to cuts during fiscal downturns.

## The Opportunity Cost

City infrastructure—streets, transit, zoning, tax incentives—enables significant private wealth
creation.  Apartment buildings appreciate because of public investment in neighbourhood amenities
and transit, yet public returns are limited to property taxes.  The current model treats low‑income
residents as perpetual tenants; it does not convert public support into resident ownership.  The
opportunity cost is enormous: over a ten‑year period the status quo yields **US$0** in household
wealth【936499250569345†L93-L96】, while eviction and shelter costs continue to mount.  Redirecting a
portion of subsidies into an equity instrument could provide tenants with a stake in the assets
they help support, reduce reliance on shelters and legal services, and transform public spending
into a wealth‑building strategy.

## Crisis Snapshot

- **Evictions & Homelessness:** New York City courts process **95,000+ eviction cases** annually,
and more than **64,000 people** live in city shelters at any given time.  Youth homelessness is at
record levels; during the 2023–24 school year over **154,000 students** lacked stable housing.
These figures illustrate that current programmes are failing to provide lasting security.

- **Expenditure vs. Outcomes:** The city spends about **US$3 billion** each year on shelters,
legal services and emergency rent programmes.  Despite this, most households receiving rent
subsidies have **zero accumulated equity** after ten years, and the cycle of eviction and
homelessness continues【936499250569345†L93-L96】.

- **Legacy Programme Shortcomings:** Previous attempts at resident ownership, such as the **Tenant
Interim Lease (TIL)** and **ANCP** programmes, promised cooperative ownership but were undermined by
administrative mismanagement and warehousing.  Mixed‑income cooperatives relied heavily on
federal subsidies; low‑income members became minority owners and lacked control.  The key lesson
is that ownership programmes must ensure strong resident governance, predictable capital and
minimal dependence on federal subsidies.

This persistent crisis, combined with widening racial wealth gaps, underscores the need for a new
framework that not only stabilises tenants but also converts public support into durable assets
for the people it aims to serve.
