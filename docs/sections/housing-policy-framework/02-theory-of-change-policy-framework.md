# Section 2: Theory of Change & Policy Framework

## Root Causes and Barriers

- **Structural Racism and Exclusion.**  Decades of racial redlining, credit exclusion and restrictive zoning have systematically blocked Black and Latino households from accumulating housing wealth.  Federal voucher programs impose inflexible rules—such as limits on portability and prohibitions on cooperative purchases—that reinforce these barriers.

- **Administrative Fragmentation.**  Duplicate subsidy programs across HPD, HRA and NYCHA create administrative layering; emergency shelter and eviction costs are rising faster than inflation, eroding fiscal sustainability.

- **Permanent Renting and Wealth Gap.**  Because tenants have no asset pathway, tens of thousands of New Yorkers remain permanent renters while subsidies enrich landlords.  This dynamic perpetuates the city’s racial homeownership gap, where Black and Latino households lag white households by 17–27 percentage points.

## Theory of Change

The Tenant Co‑op Acquisition Program (TCAP) rests on a simple but transformative theory: **redirecting subsidies from rent payments into equity stakes can dismantle intergenerational wealth barriers while maintaining affordability.**  By shifting the purpose of housing assistance from securing a landlord’s income to building tenant capital, TCAP aims to close racial wealth gaps, reduce eviction risks and create democratic control over housing.

The program’s logic model connects inputs—existing housing assistance payments and public oversight—to outputs such as limited‑equity cooperative shares and community land trust (CLT) ownership structures.  These outputs lead to outcomes: wealth accumulation, reduced shelter use and enhanced housing stability, which in turn produce systemic impacts such as narrowing racial homeownership disparities and stabilizing neighborhoods.

### Program Design Phases

1. **Equity Accrual Phase (Years 1–5).**  Tenants continue paying roughly 30 % of income in rent while the city diverts **$200–$400 per month** from the Housing Assistance Payment to individual equity accounts.  Tenants receive monthly statements tracking their growing stake.

1. **Equity Maturation Phase (Years 6–15).**  Tenants remain in the property, the city continues equity contributions and residents may exercise an option to purchase at appraised value minus accumulated equity.  Resale restrictions via CLTs or shared‑equity deeds preserve affordability.

1. **Legacy Ownership (Year 15+).**  Tenants transition from rent to ownership obligations; intergenerational wealth transfer begins and payments fund mortgage and property taxes.  If tenants leave, equity vests to an Affordable Housing Trust Fund to seed future participants.

## Policy Framework Options

TCAP’s policy design includes multiple pathways to scale:

- **Model A – PACT‑Plus (Rapid Pilot).**  Converts **5 000–10 000** existing NYCHA PACT units to Tenant Equity Vehicles using Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) funds; requires minimal new legislation and can launch within **2–3 years**.

- **Model B – CLT Joint Venture (Moderate Scale).**  Engages nonprofit community land trusts and reallocates **15 000–20 000** HPD subsidy units into CLT‑held properties; tenants purchase long‑term leases; timeline of **3–5 years**.

- **Model C – Hybrid (Full Scale).**  Blends RAD, CLT, limited‑equity cooperatives and community ownership to reach **50 000+ units** across HPD, NYCHA and HRA; requires state statutory amendments and a **7–10 year** horizon.

In all models, **tenant entities form limited‑equity cooperatives (SLECs)** that embed democratic governance, one‑household‑one‑vote rules and affordability covenants.  The program targets closing the racial homeownership gap by **4–6 percentage points**, generating **$64 million** in intergenerational wealth across **2 000 units** within a decade and achieving a **2.9:1** fiscal return.

## Guiding Principles

TCAP is built on principles of tenant empowerment, voluntary participation, racial equity, long‑term affordability, financial sustainability, democratic governance, interagency collaboration and transparency.  The program prioritizes households currently receiving vouchers or other rental assistance, especially those in buildings with chronic code violations or facing displacement risk.

## Policy Implications

Implementing TCAP requires enacting a **Public Equity Transfer Act**, formalising a **Subsidized Limited‑Equity Cooperative classification**, expanding **Tenant Opportunity to Purchase rights** and establishing a dedicated **Implementation & Oversight Task Force**.  Each legal component enables subsidy conversion, codifies cooperative governance, ensures purchase opportunities for tenants and mandates continuous evaluation.  Together these laws translate the theory of change into a durable institutional framework that can reshape New York City’s housing system.
