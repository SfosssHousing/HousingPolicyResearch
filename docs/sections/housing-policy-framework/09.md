# Section 9 – Risk Mitigation, Oversight & Evaluation

## 9.1 Success Metrics & Continuous Evaluation

TCAP’s ambition—to convert rent subsidies into equity and close racial wealth gaps—requires
rigorous, transparent evaluation.  As described in Section 7, the programme’s **outcome metrics**
track tenant wealth accumulation (US$0 baseline → US$15 000 by year 3 → US$75 000 by year 10),
increases in homeownership rates (0 % baseline → 5–8 % after three years → 20–30 % after ten
years), the number of units in perpetual affordability (≈400 000 baseline → 405 000 after three
years → 450 000 after ten years), municipal return on investment (negative baseline → break‐even
by year 3 → +US$500 million to US$1 billion by year 10), resident satisfaction (target ≥80 %) and
the proportion of participating households that are Black or Latino (goal ≥60 %)【597013538936435†L452-L462】.

**Process metrics** measure operational effectiveness: enrolment of at least 80 % of eligible
households within 18 months, equity allocation accuracy ≥99 %, default rates \<10 % and tenant
satisfaction scores (Net Promoter Score ≥50)【597013538936435†L466-L470】.  These metrics will be
reported quarterly during the pilot phase and annually thereafter.  An independent evaluation team
will compare outcomes against a control group of voucher recipients who remain in traditional
rental assistance programmes and will publish findings in a publicly accessible dashboard.

## 9.2 Risk Mitigation & Contingency Planning

The PETF model introduces new financial and legal structures; robust risk management is therefore
built into the legislation.  The **risk register** identifies critical risks, assesses their
probability and impact, and defines mitigation strategies and contingency triggers【597013538936435†L474-L506】:

| Risk                                | Probability / Impact | Mitigation & Response                                                                                                                                                                       | Contingency Trigger                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Statutory or Legal Challenge**    | Moderate/High        | PETF relies on *home rule* authority and fair housing objectives; City will provide legal defense and enlist state legislative sponsors; advocacy partners prepare amicus briefs.           | If a court injunction halts the programme, shift to a **pilot CLT** funded by philanthropic capital until litigation resolves.                            |
| **Tenant Default Rates >10 %**      | Moderate/Moderate    | Credit union partners underwrite affordability and provide financial education; escrow accounts capture equity rent; emergency assistance fund covers temporary shocks.                     | If default rate exceeds 10 %, the City may purchase struggling shares and convert the building to 100 % CLT ownership.                                    |
| **Property Market Downturn >15 %**  | Moderate/High        | Diversified portfolio of properties, municipal reserve fund and risk‑pool insurance; independent stress tests guide adjustments.                                                            | If market value drops more than 15 %, temporarily pause new PETF conversions and provide liquidity support from the municipal reserve.                    |
| **Government Capacity Constraints** | High/Moderate        | Cross‑agency task force integrates housing, finance, and legal expertise; heavy use of technical assistance from non‑profit partners; digital platform automates enrollment and compliance. | If agency staffing shortages cause delays beyond 90 days, temporarily cap new conversions and recruit external consultants.                               |
| **Tenant Turnover >30 %**           | High/Moderate        | Ten‑year vesting schedule discourages speculative exits; outreach and counseling programmes foster community stability.                                                                     | If turnover exceeds 30 %, freeze new sales and adjust vesting schedule (e.g., extend vesting period or impose resale penalty) while investigating causes. |
| **Credit Union Partner Withdrawal** | Low/Low              | Memoranda of understanding with multiple credit unions; backup partnership with a public bank; ongoing performance monitoring.                                                              | If a partner withdraws without replacement, temporarily suspend new loans and shift financing to the public bank option.                                  |

Other identified risks include information technology failures, fraud, acts of nature (e.g., flood
damage) and state pre‑emption.  The risk register assigns responsible parties and timelines for
mitigation actions.  The municipal reserve fund provides a fiscal backstop and is capitalised
through modest surcharges on PETF transactions and redeployment of unused voucher funds.  An
external auditor will review the reserve fund annually to ensure adequacy and compliance with
fiduciary obligations.

## 9.3 Oversight, Reporting & Public Accountability

**Multi‑layered oversight** ensures that PETF remains mission‑aligned and legally compliant:

- **Oversight Board** – Comprising tenant‑owner representatives, civil rights advocates, housing
  finance experts and city officials, the board meets quarterly to review programme performance,
  approve risk management changes and advise the City Council.  Minutes and vote tallies are
  published on the programme’s website.

- **Office of Cooperative Governance (OCG)** – Within the Department of Housing Preservation and
  Development, the OCG audits SLEC finances, mediates disputes, enforces equity and resale caps and
  provides technical assistance.  The OCG has power to appoint receivers and to recommend policy
  changes.

- **Independent Evaluators** – Universities or research institutes are contracted to conduct
  impact evaluations, including comparative analysis of tenant wealth, racial equity outcomes and
  public expenditure.  Evaluators submit annual reports to the Oversight Board and City Council.

- **Transparency & Reporting** – All PETF contracts, cooperative bylaws, annual budgets and audit
  reports are public records subject to Freedom of Information Law.  The programme maintains a data
  dashboard that tracks key metrics and publishes quarterly progress updates.  Tenant‑owners have
  access to financial statements and may petition the ombudsperson for redress.

- **Legislative Review** – After a three‑year pilot period, the City Council must hold public
  hearings and vote on whether to scale, modify or sunset the programme.  A 10‑year independent
  review will reassess programme impacts, and continuation beyond year 10 requires Council renewal
  and state concurrence.

These oversight mechanisms, combined with the risk register and evaluation framework, ensure that
TCAP/PETF remains responsive, transparent and aligned with its racial justice mission.  Failure
to meet defined performance thresholds or to correct identified inequities will trigger
modifications, pauses or sunset clauses.  The programme is thus built to learn, adapt and be held
accountable to the communities it serves.
