| Phase | Timeline | Objectives & Activities |
|---|---|---|
| **Silent Baseline (Weeks 1–2)** | Gather data | Submit FOIL requests to HPD, NYCHA and HRA for subsidy and tenant demographic data; review national TEV literature; conduct internal CFO and legal reviews【597013538936435†L321-L327】 |
| **Internal Vetting (Weeks 3–6)** | Develop first draft | Present confidential briefings to HPD, NYCHA and HRA leadership; reconcile budget models; obtain civil rights legal memo (Title VI & FHA compliance)【597013538936435†L329-L332】 |
| **Stakeholder Interviews (Weeks 7–9)** | Build external support | Meet with credit union coalitions, tenant advocacy groups, CLT partners and HUD field offices to refine design and address operational concerns【597013538936435†L333-L338】 |
| **Pilot Design & Announcement (Weeks 10–12)** | Launch and enroll | Host Mayor/Speaker briefing; release public information via NYC.gov; conduct community board outreach in target neighborhoods; commence tenant enrollment and baseline data collection【597013538936435†L339-L343】 |

## Change Management Considerations

- **Communication:** Clear, consistent messaging is essential to counter misinformation and reduce fears about eligibility loss.  Use plain‑language materials, infographics and community ambassadors to explain how equity accrual works.

- **Capacity Building:** Agencies must invest in training staff to manage equity accounts and support tenants.  Partners like credit unions and CDFIs should receive technical guidance on underwriting limited‑equity co‑ops.

- **Inclusive Outreach:** Engagement strategies should prioritise historically marginalized neighborhoods and ensure language access.  Partnerships with community organizations and civil rights groups can help reach tenants who are often excluded.

- **Feedback Loops:** Regular surveys, focus groups and open forums will allow tenants and stakeholders to provide feedback.  Adjust program design and communications based on this feedback to build trust and responsiveness.

- **Transparency:** Publicly available dashboards, annual reports and open meetings of the TCAP Task Force will promote accountability and allow external observers to monitor progress.

## Conclusion

A robust stakeholder engagement strategy and phased change management plan will help TCAP secure political support, mitigate concerns and foster community ownership of the program.  By involving tenants, agencies, financial partners and advocates early and consistently, the city can build a coalition that not only supports TCAP’s launch but also sustains it through implementation and expansion.
