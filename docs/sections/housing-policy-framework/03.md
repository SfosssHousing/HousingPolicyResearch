# Section 3: Financial Modeling & ROI Analysis

## Overview

This section examines the fiscal implications of converting rental subsidies into Tenant Equity Vehicles (TEVs).  It compares the status quo—where the city spends billions on rental assistance with no equity return—to the proposed equity‑transfer model, using both per‑unit and program‑wide projections over a 15‑year horizon.

## Key Assumptions

| Parameter                  | Baseline/PET Value              | Source                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant monthly income      | **$2,400** (50 % AMI)           | Key assumptions table【597013538936435†L150-L161】                  |
| Current rent payment       | **$720/mo** (30 % of income)    | HUD standard【597013538936435†L154-L157】                           |
| Current HAP subsidy        | **$1,200/mo**                   | Market rent gap (NYC median $3,491/mo)【597013538936435†L154-L158】 |
| Annual equity allocation   | **$3,000** per tenant ($250/mo) | 25 % of HAP reallocation【597013538936435†L158-L159】               |
| Property appreciation rate | **2 – 4 %/yr**                  | Conservative (2 %), base (3 %), optimistic (4 %) assumptions        |
| Program duration           | **15 years**                    | Ownership threshold【597013538936435†L160-L161】                    |

## Per‑Unit 15‑Year Projection

| Metric                          | Status Quo (Baseline)              | PET – Conservative (2 %) | PET – Base Case (3 %) | PET – Optimistic (4 %) |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Cumulative subsidy per unit** | **$216,000** (15 yrs × $14,400/yr) | **$216,000**             | **$216,000**          | **$216,000**           |
| **Tenant equity after 15 yrs**  | $0                                 | **$45,000**              | **$45,000**           | **$45,000**            |
| **Property appreciation**       | $0                                 | **$138,347**             | **$223,187**          | **$320,377**           |
| **Total wealth per unit**       | $0                                 | **$183,347**             | **$268,187**          | **$365,377**           |

*Note:* Figures are from the 15‑year projection model; property appreciation varies by assumed growth rate.  Under all scenarios, the public subsidy remains the same, but tenant wealth increases dramatically.

## Program‑Wide 10,000‑Unit Pilot Scenario

Under the proposed PACT‑Plus pilot (Model A), 10 000 NYCHA PACT units are converted to TEVs.  The status quo would expend **$2.16 billion** over 15 years with no equity return【597013538936435†L165-L170】.  In contrast, the PET scenario reallocates the same subsidy but produces the following results:

- **Tenant equity accumulation:** $45 000 per household; **$450 million** across 10 000 households【597013538936435†L177-L178】.
- **Property appreciation:** Approximately **$2 billion** collective gain at 3 % annual appreciation【597013538936435†L179-L183】.
- **Municipal ROI:** Net present value of **$850 million–$1.2 billion** over 15 years, with an internal rate of return of **4.5–6.2 %**【597013538936435†L185-L190】.
- **Implementation cost:** about **$500 000** for start‑up (90‑day period) and **$2–3 million per year** for operations (staffing & IT)【958638587955073†L44-L50】.

## Comparative Analysis

- **Status Quo:** Each unit receives an average of **$14,400** in annual subsidy, totalling **$216,000** over 15 years.  Tenants build no equity, and the city receives no return【597013538936435†L165-L170】.
- **PET Model:** The city continues to spend **$14,400** per unit per year, but redirects **$3,000** annually into a personal equity account, leaving **$2,760** of HAP to pay to landlords【597013538936435†L172-L177】.  After 15 years, each tenant owns **$45,000** of equity and benefits from property appreciation.  Aggregate wealth creation for 10 000 units is **$2.45 billion** (equity + appreciation)【597013538936435†L177-L183】.

### Annual Cost Comparison (per unit)

| Category                    | Status Quo  | TCAP Model  | Net Difference      |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| Subsidy payment             | **$22,000** | **$18,000** | **+$4,000** savings |
| Administration & compliance | **$2,000**  | **$1,200**  | **+$800** savings   |
| Shelter/eviction risk       | **$4,500**  | **$700**    | **+$3,800** savings |
| Technical assistance        | $0          | **$1,200**  | **–$1,200** cost    |
| **Annual total**            | **$28,500** | **$21,100** | **+$7,400** savings |

This comparison suggests that redirecting subsidies into equity not only creates wealth but also reduces administrative, shelter and eviction costs.  Even after adding technical assistance expenses, the net per‑unit savings is approximately **$7,400** per year (analysis adapted from cost comparison table in the draft proposal).

## Risk Factors and Mitigation

| Risk                            | Impact                                                         | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tenant default/turnover**     | 20–30 % of participants may exit before year 5                 | Implement vesting schedules; roll over equity to new tenants; establish default insurance reserves【597013538936435†L192-L199】                 |
| **Property underperformance**   | Market downturn could reduce appreciation                      | Use community land trusts (CLTs) and deed restrictions to lock affordability; prevent speculative losses【597013538936435†L199-L203】           |
| **Statutory/legal challenges**  | Courts could dispute subsidy use for equity                    | Leverage Section 8(y) homeownership precedent; frame wealth‑building as a legitimate governmental interest【597013538936435†L200-L203】         |
| **Agency capacity constraints** | HPD/NYCHA may lack staff and systems to manage equity accounts | Create a dedicated Tenant Equity Fund (TEF) or contract data management to credit unions; ensure adequate staffing【597013538936435†L203-L206】 |

## Conclusion

The financial model demonstrates that converting rental subsidies into tenant equity is both **budget‑neutral and wealth‑generative**.  Using conservative assumptions, the PET framework produces significant returns for tenants and the city while lowering per‑unit costs.  A scaled pilot of 10 000 units would generate hundreds of millions in tenant wealth and billions in collective property appreciation without increasing municipal expenditures.  The risk analysis shows that foreseeable challenges can be mitigated through thoughtful program design, legal alignment and adequate operational capacity.
