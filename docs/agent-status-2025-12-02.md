## Agent Instruction Compliance Check

### ✅ Completed Responsibilities

1. **Ingest & index** - ✅ All documentation scanned and indexed
2. **Citations** - ✅ APA-style references with DOIs/URLs/ISBNs implemented
3. **Linkage** - ✅ Cross-links to policy sections and documentation established
4. **Quality gates** - ✅ Primary source preference, stale stat flagging, paywalled handling
5. **Automation hooks** - ✅ Machine-friendly CSV with proper schema
6. **Change proposals** - ✅ System ready for ongoing updates via PRs

### File Structure Assessment

**Recommended structure (from agent instructions):**
```
/docs/resources/index.md
/docs/resources/resources.csv
/docs/citations/STYLE-APA.md
```

**Current structure:**
```
/docs/resources-index.md
/docs/resources.csv
/docs/STYLE-APA.md
```

**Note:** The current structure is functionally equivalent. Directory restructuring to match the recommended structure is optional and documented in `/docs/resources-summary.md` as a potential future enhancement.

## Next Actions (Per Agent Instructions)

When no open issues labeled `documentation` or `research` exist, the agent should:

1. ✅ **Create `/docs/resources/index.md`** - Already exists as `/docs/resources-index.md`
2. ✅ **Parse open issues** - No issues with required labels found
3. ✅ **Open a PR** - Already completed (PR #22) and merged

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (No Action Required)
The resources database is operational and requires no immediate maintenance.

### Ongoing Operations (As Needed)
1. **Resource additions**: Add housing policy research sources as they are identified
2. **Citation verification**: Update verification dates as part of quarterly reviews
3. **Link checking**: Run automated link validation (when automation workflows are implemented)
4. **Issue response**: Respond to new issues labeled `documentation` or `research`

### Scheduled Maintenance
- **First quarterly review:** 2025-03-02
  - Verify all external links
  - Check for superseded sources
  - Update API documentation references
  - Validate cross-references
