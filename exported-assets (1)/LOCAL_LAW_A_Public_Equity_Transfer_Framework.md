# LOCAL LAW A: PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER FRAMEWORK FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

## Complete Legislative Text (Draft)

______________________________________________________________________

## BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 18 of title 26 to read as follows:

______________________________________________________________________

# CHAPTER 18: PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER FRAMEWORK (TCAP)

## § 26-1801 Purpose and Declaration of Policy

The council hereby finds and declares that:

(a) New York City faces a historic affordability crisis, with over 1.7 million renter households spending more than 30% of income on rent, and the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment exceeding $2,500 per month as of 2024.

(b) Current rental subsidy programs, including CityFHEPS and other voucher assistance, provide critical support but do not enable wealth-building or long-term economic stability; tenants remain permanently dependent on subsidies with zero equity accumulation.

(c) Limited-equity housing cooperatives have demonstrated the capacity to combine permanent affordability with member wealth-building and democratic control, as evidenced by the Thistle cooperative (Washington, DC) and the East New York CLT and other NYC-area models.

(d) Converting a portion of housing subsidies into member equity in cooperatives would preserve the public benefit (affordability) while enabling member wealth accumulation, addressing the $156 billion racial wealth gap in NYC by prioritizing Black, Latino, and other communities of color historically excluded from homeownership.

(e) The framework established herein—the Public Equity Transfer Framework (TCAP)—creates pathways for extremely low-income households (at or below 50% of Area Median Income) to accumulate wealth, achieve housing stability, and exercise democratic control over their housing, while maintaining permanent affordability and preventing displacement.

## § 26-1802 Definitions

For purposes of this chapter:

(a) **"Area Median Income" or "AMI"**: The median family income for the New York City metropolitan area as calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, adjusted for family size.

(b) **"Carrying Charge"**: The monthly payment by a TCAP member to the cooperative, including rent, utilities, operating costs, and debt service, as established by the cooperative board and subject to the 15% affordability cap in § 26-1804.

(c) **"Community Opportunity to Purchase Act"** or **"COPA"**: The law established by Local Law Intro 902 (or successor), giving qualified nonprofits first opportunity to purchase covered residential buildings when offered for sale.

(d) **"Department"** or **"HPD"**: The New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

(e) **"DSS"**: The New York City Department of Social Services, including the Human Resources Administration and CityFHEPS program.

(f) **"Equity Account"**: An individual member's ownership stake in a TCAP cooperative, funded by subsidy redirection, mortgage principal paydown, and initial down-payment contribution, which is non-forfeitable, inheritable, and may not be pledged to secure cooperative debt.

(g) **"Qualified Entity"**: A nonprofit organization, community land trust, or tenant association designated by HPD as meeting standards for acquiring property under COPA and converting it to TCAP cooperative ownership.

(h) **"Tenant-Controlled Equity Cooperative"** or **"TCAP Cooperative"**: A limited-equity housing cooperative, incorporated under New York Cooperative Law § 1801–2000, that has adopted TCAP affordability covenants and equity-account structures and is designated by HPD as meeting TCAP program standards.

(i) **"TCAP Affordability Covenant"**: A 30-year (minimum) deed restriction, recorded on the property, requiring that all units remain permanently affordable to households at specified income levels, carrying charges do not exceed 15% of member income, member resale rights are governed by an affordability-preserving formula, and no unit may be converted to market-rate without HPD approval.

## § 26-1803 Subsidy Conversion and Member Equity Allocation

(a) **Mandatory Equity Allocation**: When any housing subsidy, including but not limited to subsidies under the CityFHEPS program or equivalent rental assistance programs, is assigned or allocated to a TCAP cooperative, the Department of Social Services and HPD shall ensure that:

(1) At least 20% of the monthly subsidy amount shall be credited directly to individual member equity accounts. As of the enactment of this chapter, for a subsidy of $1,800/month, this mandate establishes a minimum of $360/month ($4,320/year) in member equity credits.

(2) At least 50% and not more than 70% of the monthly subsidy shall be applied to the cooperative's carrying charge (building operating costs, debt service, maintenance, administration).

(3) The remainder (10–30%) may be retained by the cooperative as a capital or replacement reserve, subject to periodic audit and member approval of reserve targets.

(b) **Annual Subsidy Indexing**: The total subsidy amount shall be adjusted annually, effective April 1 of each year, using the percentage change in the Rent Guidelines Board's Price Index of Operating Costs (PIOC), or if PIOC is discontinued, the Consumer Price Index for the New York City metropolitan area, to ensure adequate carrying-charge coverage and maintenance of the 15% member affordability cap.

(c) **Reporting**: HPD and DSS shall jointly report to the City Council by March 31 of each year on subsidy allocation compliance and any cooperatives not receiving the mandated equity allocation.

## § 26-1804 Member Affordability Cap

(a) **15% Income Cap**: No TCAP member shall be required to pay a carrying charge exceeding 15% of their verified household income in any month. This affordability cap is enforceable, non-waivable, and shall be maintained in perpetuity or for so long as the member remains a cooperative shareholder.

(b) **Cap Recalculation**: If a member's household income changes, their carrying charge cap shall be recalculated upon annual income verification or at the member's request.

(c) **Income Growth Exception**: If a member's income grows to exceed 80% of Area Median Income, the member's carrying charge may increase to not more than 20% of income, provided that HPD and DSS jointly determine that such increase does not undermine the member's ability to maintain the equity account.

(d) **Hardship Accommodation**: Members facing temporary income loss or hardship may request a subsidy adjustment or temporary carrying charge reduction. Requests shall be reviewed by the cooperative board and HPD; any approved reduction shall not forfeit or reduce the member's equity credits.

(e) **Subsidy Obligation**: If a cooperative's carrying charge costs exceed the amount derivable from member payments (capped at 15% of income) plus the 80% subsidy allocation, HPD and DSS shall jointly increase subsidy levels to maintain the 15% cap.

(f) **Enforcement**: HPD shall monitor member carrying charges annually; any cooperative charging above the 15% cap shall be issued a compliance notice per § 26-1808.

## § 26-1805 Member Equity Account Structure and Protections

(a) **Establishment**: Upon member certification and admission to a TCAP cooperative, each member shall have an individual equity account established and registered with the cooperative and HPD.

(b) **Funding Sources**:

(1) **Subsidy Redirection**: 20% of monthly housing subsidy (minimum $360/month for a $1,800 subsidy), credited monthly.

(2) **Principal Paydown**: Member's pro-rata share of cooperative mortgage principal paid down monthly; typically increasing from 30–40% of annual debt service in Year 1 to 60–70% by Year 20 as interest decreases.

(3) **Initial Down-Payment Contribution**: Member's share at entry, typically $8,000 per member, funded via savings accumulation, savings match, and subsidy advance.

(c) **Ownership and Control**:

(1) The equity account is the exclusive property of the individual member.

(2) The cooperative holds equity in trust and may not pledge it to secure cooperative debt or assessments.

(3) Equity shall not be subject to setoff or counterclaim in disputes with the cooperative.

(d) **Non-Forfeiture**: Equity shall not be forfeited upon member's departure, voluntary withdrawal, or death; member or heir shall receive equity upon exit or by inheritance.

(e) **Quarterly Reporting**: Cooperatives shall provide quarterly equity statements to each member showing:

(1) Opening balance.

(2) YTD subsidy redirection credits.

(3) YTD principal paydown credits.

(4) Current balance.

(5) Year-end projected balance.

Statements shall be provided in English and the languages spoken by 10% or more of members.

(f) **Annual Verification**: HPD shall verify equity accounting annually; audits shall confirm correct credit of subsidy amounts and principal.

## § 26-1806 Use and Disposition of Member Equity

(a) **Exit and Resale**: If a member voluntarily leaves the cooperative or sells their share, the member shall receive their accumulated equity in one of the following forms:

(1) A lump-sum payment from the cooperative's reserve or refinancing proceeds.

(2) A pro-rata share of building sale proceeds above the mortgage balance (if the cooperative is sold).

(3) By inheritance to a designated family member who assumes membership.

(b) **Refinancing Distributions**: If the cooperative refinances its mortgage at a lower interest rate or otherwise realizes building cost savings, members may receive a pro-rata distribution of savings, subject to board approval and maintenance of minimum capital reserves.

(c) **Prohibitions on Seizure**:

(1) Member equity may not be seized to satisfy cooperative debt, liens, or special assessments.

(2) Creditors of the cooperative may not attach or execute against member equity.

(3) Member equity shall be exempt from execution and levy by third-party creditors of the member, to the extent permitted by law.

(d) **Exemption from Means-Tested Benefits**: Member equity shall be exempt from asset calculations for SNAP, Medicaid, subsidized childcare, and other means-tested programs, up to a cap established by HPD (initially $50,000 per member account).

(e) **Transferability**: Member equity (and the associated share) may not be transferred to non-members except by inheritance; the heir assumes membership and the associated carrying charge obligation.

(f) **Succession Rights**: Upon a member's death, designated family members may inherit the membership, share, and equity account; the heir's carrying charge shall comply with the 15% affordability cap based on the heir's verified income.

## § 26-1807 TCAP Affordability Covenant: Requirements and Recording

(a) **Mandatory Covenant**: Every TCAP cooperative property shall have a TCAP Affordability Covenant recorded as a deed restriction on the property within 30 days of cooperative formation or building acquisition.

(b) **Covenant Duration**: The covenant shall run with the land for a minimum of 30 years, with automatic renewal or perpetual language such that the restriction survives property resale, refinancing, and member turnover.

(c) **Covenant Terms**: The covenant shall provide that:

(1) **Permanent Affordability**: All units in the building shall be and remain permanently affordable, serving households at or below 50% of Area Median Income (or, for households initially eligible at entry, at adjusted affordability levels as determined by HPD for households earning up to 80% AMI).

(2) **Carrying Charge Cap**: Carrying charges shall not exceed 15% of member household income, indexed annually.

(3) **Member Resale Rights**: Member resale shall be governed by an HPD-approved formula limiting sales prices to formula prices (typically 90–110% of original member purchase price adjusted for inflation), preventing speculation while allowing moderate appreciation.

(4) **No Market-Rate Conversion**: No unit may be converted to market-rate occupancy, sold to a non-member (except by inheritance), or removed from affordability without HPD and City Council approval.

(5) **Democratic Governance**: Member assembly voting, annual elections, and democratic board governance shall be maintained in perpetuity.

(d) **Covenant Priority**: The TCAP affordability covenant shall be senior to all mortgages and liens; lenders shall acknowledge the covenant in all loan documents and appraisals.

(e) **Recordation**: The covenant shall be recorded in the county where the property is located and shall include:

(1) Property address and tax block/lot.

(2) Covenant restrictions and affordability limits.

(3) Term (30 years minimum; renewal or perpetual language).

(4) Enforcement parties (HPD, City, members, CLT partners if applicable).

## § 26-1808 Covenant Enforcement and Remedies

(a) **Enforcement Authority**: HPD, the NYC Law Department, and members of the cooperative shall have authority to enforce TCAP affordability covenants through:

(1) Civil injunction preventing covenant violation.

(2) Specific performance compelling compliance with affordability terms.

(3) Damages for breach, including refund of excess charges to members (with interest from date of excess payment).

(b) **Member Standing**: Members shall be recognized as third-party beneficiaries of affordability covenants, with standing to bring enforcement actions individually or as a class.

(c) **Right to Cure**: Before seeking injunctive or other equitable relief, HPD shall provide the cooperative 30 days' written notice specifying identified violations and required corrective action; only if cure is not achieved shall enforcement action proceed.

(d) **Remedies for Breach**:

(1) **Excess Carrying Charge**: If a cooperative charges carrying charges exceeding 15% of member income, the member shall be entitled to refund of excess charges plus interest (at the rate of prime plus 2%) from the date of excess payment.

(2) **Equity Account Restoration**: If member equity is improperly reduced, seized, or forfeited, the cooperative shall restore the account with interest.

(3) **Governance Intervention**: If board mismanagement or discrimination causes covenant breach, HPD may mandate:
\- Member assembly-supervised board restructuring.
\- Temporary HPD-appointed management.
\- Removal of specific board members.

(4) **Receivership** (Last Resort): For egregious or pervasive covenant breach threatening member welfare (e.g., building maintenance failure, insolvency, systematic fraud), HPD may petition the Supreme Court to appoint a receiver for the cooperative, operating it pending member restructuring or, if necessary, asset liquidation and member equity distribution.

(e) **Public Reporting**: HPD shall annually report to the City Council the number and nature of covenant enforcement actions undertaken.

## § 26-1809 Recordation, Renewal, and Duration of Affordability Covenant

(a) **Initial Recording**: The TCAP affordability covenant shall be recorded in the county where the property is located within 30 days of cooperative formation or building acquisition.

(b) **Recording Information**: The recorded covenant shall identify:

(1) Property address and tax block/lot identification.

(2) Covenant terms and affordability restrictions.

(3) Term (minimum 30 years; renewal or perpetual language).

(4) Enforcement authority (HPD, NYC Law Department, members, qualified nonprofits).

(5) Contact information for enforcement inquiries.

(c) **Renewal**: At the end of 30 years, if the covenant is set to expire, HPD and the cooperative shall jointly renew it for an additional 30-year term or declare it perpetual, subject to City Council approval if perpetual status requires legislative action.

(d) **Subordination and Financing**: All lenders, title companies, and insurers shall acknowledge the TCAP affordability covenant in all mortgage documents, title insurance commitments, and policy endorsements. The covenant shall not be subordinated to any subsequent lien without written HPD approval.

## § 26-1810 Membership Rights and Protections
