# PART I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & POLICY OVERVIEW

## 1.1 Core Research Question

**How might New York City reconceptualize and structurally redesign its housing subsidy infrastructure to facilitate not only affordability but actual tenant ownership, thereby enabling sustainable intergenerational wealth accumulation within historically disenfranchised and racially marginalized communities?**

This question animates the Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP), a transformative policy initiative that reframes public housing subsidies—currently deployed as temporary rent payments flowing to private landlords—as permanent equity-building instruments controlled by tenants.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

### The Crisis Context

New York City's housing subsidy system is structurally designed to perpetuate tenant dependence while enriching private landlords. The current model:

- **$32,800 annual cost per unit** (Section 8 + shelter response + admin overhead)
- **Zero wealth accumulation** for low-income renters
- **Perpetual landlord control** over property maintenance, displacement decisions, rent levels
- **Disproportionate impact** on communities of color, who face homeownership barriers reinforced by discrimination

### Historical Roots: The TIL Failure

The 1990s Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) program promised tenant ownership of abandoned buildings acquired through in rem foreclosure. **The program largely failed**, with only ~250 units remaining in permanent tenant ownership out of thousands involved. Critical gaps included:

- Insufficient funding for building stabilization
- Inadequate technical assistance for governance
- Insufficient long-term affordability protections
- Lack of integration with ongoing subsidy support
- Limited legal accountability

**TCAP learns from this history**, building in mandatory financing, TA, governance standards, and long-term affordability covenants from inception.

### The Wealth Gap Imperative

Racial disparities in homeownership persist at crisis levels:

- **White homeownership:** ~70%
- **Black homeownership:** ~42%
- **Latino homeownership:** ~48%

This gap reflects centuries of exclusion: redlining, discriminatory lending, evictions, and exclusion from publicly-subsidized homeownership programs. TCAP directly addresses this inequity by targeting subsidized properties in communities with lowest homeownership rates.

## 1.3 TCAP Innovation Framework

**Core Innovation:** Transform housing subsidies from **rental-support instruments** (Section 8, CityFHEPS, HASA) into **equity-building instruments** that:

1. **Redirect subsidy flows** from landlord pockets to tenant share purchases
1. **Establish permanent affordability** through limited-equity cooperative structure + 30-year covenants
1. **Embed democratic governance** with tenant control (one member, one vote)
1. **Ensure financial stability** through subsidy-backed acquisition financing + reserve funds
1. **Generate intergenerational wealth** through equity accumulation + property improvements

**Mechanism:**

Rather than monthly rent payments ($1,800/month = $21,600/year), the same subsidy is reallocated:

- **Years 1-2:** 50% equity ($900/month) + 50% carrying charges ($900/month)
- **Years 3-4:** 65% equity ($1,170/month) + 35% carrying charges ($630/month)
- **Year 5+:** 75% equity ($1,350/month) + 25% carrying charges ($450/month), with subsidy phase-out eligibility reviews

**Result:** Within 5 years, a tenant earning $25,000/year has accumulated $48,000+ in cooperative equity while maintaining housing affordability.

## 1.4 Key Outcomes & ROI

### Primary Targets (10-Year Goals)

| Metric                                 | Target                       |

# PART II: POLICY FRAMEWORK & STRATEGIC DESIGN

## 2.1 TCAP Mission & Guiding Principles

### Mission Statement

Transform public housing subsidies from temporary rent payments into permanent equity-building instruments that enable tenant collective ownership, wealth accumulation, and democratic control, advancing racial and economic justice in NYC.

### Guiding Principles

1. **Tenant Empowerment:** Tenants lead the process; city agencies play supportive roles
1. **Voluntary Participation:** No tenant forced to participate; non-participants retain rental housing with full subsidy
1. **Racial Equity:** Explicitly prioritize historically excluded communities; target 40%+ Black and Latino participants
1. **Long-Term Affordability:** Maintain 30+ year affordability commitments through deed restrictions
1. **Financial Sustainability:** Ensure cooperatives have capital and subsidy support to survive economic shocks
1. **Democratic Governance:** Guarantee tenant control via one-member-one-vote structure
1. **Interagency Collaboration:** Seamless coordination across HPD, DSS, NYCHA, HCR, NYC Law, CDFI partners
1. **Transparency & Accountability:** Public reporting of metrics, independent evaluation, stakeholder engagement
1. **Legal Compliance:** Full adherence to Fair Housing Act, NYC Human Rights Law, language access (Local Law 30), cooperative law
1. **Evidence-Based Design:** Build on lessons from TIL, HDFC, co-ops elsewhere; rigorous evaluation; willingness to course-correct

## 2.2 Subsidy Redirection Architecture

### Current Subsidy Landscape

**Convertible Subsidy Programs:**

- **Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV):** ~500,000 vouchers nationwide; ~125,000 in NYC area
- **CityFHEPS:** ~30,000 households in NYC
- **HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA):** ~4,000 households in NYC
- **Other state/local subsidies:** ~15,000 households
- **Total NYC-based convertible subsidies:** ~150,000 households in rental housing

### Phase-In Structure (5-Year Transition)

**Why phase-in?** Tenants need predictable income for mortgages + memberships require subsidy stability. Gradual shift allows:

1. Cooperative financial stabilization
1. Member adjustment to "dual" payments (equity + carrying charge)
1. Board development and governance maturation
1. Reserve fund accumulation for capital needs

**Allocation Schedule:**

**Years 1-2: Stabilization Phase**

- 50% of subsidy → Cooperative equity/reserves
- 50% of subsidy → Carrying charges (maintenance, taxes, utilities, debt service)
- **Example:** $1,800/month voucher = $900 equity + $900 carrying charges
- **Purpose:** Build ownership stake while stabilizing finances

**Years 3-4: Acceleration Phase**

- 65% of subsidy → Equity/reserves
- 35% of subsidy → Carrying charges
- **Example:** $1,800/month voucher = $1,170 equity + $630 carrying charges
- **Purpose:** Accelerate equity while maintaining affordability

**Year 5+: Maturity Phase**

- 75% of subsidy → Equity/reserves
- 25% of subsidy → Carrying charges
- **Example:** $1,800/month voucher = $1,350 equity + $450 carrying charges
- **Subsidy phase-out review:** Annual recertification; HH income ≥200% poverty loses subsidy; HH income 100-200% may reduce subsidy by 25%/year
- **Purpose:** Full transition to co-op ownership; subsidy becomes targeted safety net for lowest-income households

### Subsidy Allocation Account Structure

**Three distinct accounts per cooperative member:**

1. **Share Acquisition Account**

   - Receives equity portion of subsidy each month
   - Accumulates until sufficient for down payment + initial carrying charge reserve
   - Converted to share ownership at closing
   - Member has claim to value if they exit (subject to resale restrictions)

1. **Cooperative Reserve Account**

   - Receives 2-3% of monthly subsidy + member contributions
   - Built to minimum $5,000/unit by end of Year 2
   - Maintains ongoing $100/unit/month contribution
   - Used for capital improvements, emergency repairs, building stabilization

1. **Debt Service Escrow**

   - Receives portion of carrying charge allocation
   - Ensures loan payments made automatically
   - HPD + lender co-signers until Year 3
   - Transferred to cooperative board control upon maturity

- Current recipients of Section 8 HCV, CityFHEPS, HASA, or other convertible city/state subsidy
- Income at or below 80% Area Median Income (AMI) at time of conversion
- No fraud or material lease violations in past 5 years

**Participation:**

- Membership is 100% voluntary
- Non-participating tenants can remain as renters with full subsidy support
- No lease termination or rent increase for participating tenants
- No harassment or retaliation for participation (protected under Local Law C)

**Priority Populations (tiebreaker for property selection):**

- Tenants with rent burden >35% of income
- Buildings with chronic code violations (500+ open violations)
- Tenants with household heads age 55+ (intergenerational equity)
- Families with children experiencing housing instability

### Eligible Properties

**Required Criteria:**

- Location within NYC (all 5 boroughs)
- Multiple dwelling (6+ units minimum for financial viability)
- Minimum 40% subsidy-recipient tenants
- Documented housing code violations OR landlord on NYC Public Advocate's "100 Worst Landlords" list
- Financially feasible for acquisition and operation (meeting underwriting standards)
- No regulatory agreement prohibiting conversion
- Clear title (or lien resolution plan)

**Preferred Criteria:**

- Buildings receiving LIHTC benefits (unless waiver obtained + affordability covenant runs concurrently)
- Properties under Article 7A receivership (case-by-case review)
- Buildings with environmental contamination exceeding $50K/unit remediation cost

## 2.5 Property Selection Criteria

### Data-Driven Identification Process

**Step 1: Quantitative Analysis (quarterly)**
HPD uses integrated data from:

- DOB violation database (filtration: 500+ violations, age of violations)
- DOF property tax records and arrears
- Housing Court eviction records (concentration in building)
- DSS subsidy data (% of households receiving vouchers)
- 311 complaint patterns (heat, water, heat, mold, vermin)
- NYC Public Advocate's Worst Landlords List
- Community board referrals and tenant advocacy organization nominations

**Outputs:** Prioritized list of 50-100 properties per quarter meeting basic criteria

**Step 2: Site Assessment (120 days per property)**
For each property on priority list:

- **Physical inspection:** Building walkthrough, unit sampling (10%), code compliance assessment
- **Financial analysis:** Tax records, mortgage history, deed research, market rent comparables
- **Subsidy composition:** Count of HCV, CityFHEPS, HASA households; eligibility verification
- **Tenant readiness:** Informal outreach, existing organizing capacity, leadership identification, language access needs
- **Title search:** Clear title pathway, lien resolution plan, title insurance availability
- **Environmental screening:** Phase 1 ESA, hazardous materials survey

**Outputs:** Feasibility report recommending PROCEED, HOLD, or DECLINE

**Step 3: Community Engagement (30-60 days)**
For properties advancing:

- HPD host public information meeting at building/nearby community space
- Distribute multilingual materials on TCAP process, timeline, rights
- Facilitate initial tenant conversations with HPD staff and TA providers
- Document baseline conditions (photos, interview notes)

**Step 4: Official Eligibility Determination (30 days)**
HPD Commissioner issues determination:

- **ELIGIBLE:** Meets all criteria; approved for TCAP recruitment
- **CONDITIONALLY ELIGIBLE:** Meets most criteria; HPD will support remediation of limiting factor (e.g., lien payoff, environmental remediation) within 18-month window
- **INELIGIBLE:** Does not meet core criteria; removed from pipeline

### Community District Geographic Distribution

To ensure equitable access and avoid spatial concentration:

- Minimum 1 project per community district (32 CDs)
- Target 2-3 properties per super-district (lower Manhattan, outer boroughs, etc.)
- Explicit attention to CD sociodemographic composition:
  - Prioritize CDs with \<35% homeownership
  - Prioritize CDs with 65%+ communities of color
  - Avoid clustering in single neighborhood (prevents "cooperative gentrification")

### Adjusted Analysis: Long-Term Horizon (10+ years)

After Year 5, TCAP costs decline dramatically as one-time conversion costs are amortized and subsidies phase-out:

| Year                     | Status Quo/Unit | TCAP Model/Unit | Net Annual Savings |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Year 1                   | $32,800         | $35,700         | -$2,900            |

**Key Finding:** TCAP achieves **positive ROI by Year 7**, with cumulative 10-year net benefit of **$2.375B** for 450 properties citywide.

## 3.5 Fiscal Sustainability

### Subsidy Redeployment Economics

**Current NYC Housing Subsidy Budget:**

- Section 8 administration (HPD) + DSS HRA: ~$3.8B annually
- Emergency shelter (DHS): ~$2.5B annually
- Eviction prevention (various): ~$400M annually
- **Total: ~$6.7B annually on subsidized housing support**

**TCAP Redeployment Potential:**

- Redirect Section 8: Up to $2.5B (if applied to entire voucher population)
- Redirect CityFHEPS/HASA: $800M annually
- Redirect shelter savings (via housing stability): $1.2B
- **Total redeployable pool: $4.5B annually**

### Funding Model: Public Equity Investment Approach

Rather than treating TCAP as annual operating expense, NYC should fund it as **capital investment** with expected returns:

**Year 1-5 Investment:** $1.334B (pilot)

- **Source:** HPD capital budget + federal grants + philanthropic capital
- **Structure:** Revolving fund (loans + grants + subsidy redirection)
- **Return:** Positive after Year 7; cumulative positive $445M by Year 10

**Year 6-10 Expansion:** $1.487B

- **Source:** Savings from Years 1-5 + additional capital appropriations
- **Return:** $1.210B annually in operational cost savings

**Year 11+ Maturity:** Self-sustaining with subsidy phase-outs

### Risk Mitigation: Contingency Reserve

Establish **TCAP Stability Fund** to protect cooperatives from economic shocks:

- $50M seed capital (0.5% of 10-year investment)
- Holds reserves for member hardship assistance, emergency building repairs, temporary subsidies if federal vouchers reduced
- Replenished by 1% of annual subsidy surpluses once cooperatives stabilize (after Year 5)

______________________________________________________________________

### Subsidy Allocation Mechanics

**Year 1-2: Stabilization Phase (50% Equity / 50% Carrying Charges)**

**Example Tenant Member:** Section 8 HCV holder, household income $28,000/year, subsidy $1,800/month

| Account                     | Monthly    | Annual      |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| **Equity Contribution**     | $900       | $10,800     |
| Share Acquisition Reserve   | $700       | $8,400      |
| Cooperative Capital Reserve | $200       | $2,400      |
| **Carrying Charge Support** | $900       | $10,800     |
| Maintenance/Utilities       | $400       | $4,800      |
| Property Taxes              | $250       | $3,000      |
| Debt Service                | $250       | $3,000      |
| **Total Subsidy Deployed**  | **$1,800** | **$21,600** |

**Member Household Responsibility:**

- Operating assessment (from cooperative carrying charges): $350/month (capped at 15% of income per TCAP formula)
- Total housing cost: $1,800 subsidy + $350 member contribution = $2,150/month (7.6% of income, well below 30% affordability threshold)

**By End of Year 2:**

- Share Acquisition: $16,800
- Cooperative Capital Reserve: $4,800
- Member has ~$21,600 in cooperative equity

______________________________________________________________________

**Years 3-4: Acceleration Phase (65% Equity / 35% Carrying Charges)**

| Account                     | Monthly | Annual  |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Equity Contribution**     | $1,170  | $14,040 |
| **Carrying Charge Support** | $630    | $7,560  |

**By End of Year 4:**

- Cumulative equity: $21,600 (Yrs 1-2) + $28,080 (Yrs 3-4) = **$49,680**
- Member household responsibility increases slightly (as carrying charges grow), but stays well within affordability

______________________________________________________________________

**Year 5+: Maturity Phase (75% Equity / 25% Carrying Charges)**

| Account                      | Monthly | Annual                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Equity Contribution**      | $1,350  | $16,200                       |
| **Carrying Charge Support**  | $450    | $5,400                        |
| **Subsidy Phase-Out Review** | —       | Annual income recertification |

**Subsidy Phase-Out Triggers (Annual Recertification):**

- If household income ≥ 200% poverty line: Subsidy ends; member pays full carrying charges
- If household income 100-200% poverty: Subsidy gradually reduced (25% reduction/year over 4 years)
- If household income ≤ 100% poverty: Full subsidy continues indefinitely

**Example:** HH that started at $28,000 (70% poverty line) may not be subject to phase-out for 10+ years (if income remains stable). HH whose income grows to $60,000 (150% poverty) would see subsidy reduction of 25%/year over 4 years = no subsidy by Year 9.

- Desk review of submitted documents (financial audits, governance minutes, compliance affidavits)
- Biennial site visits with physical inspection
- Compliance scoring and performance rating
- Identification of emerging issues requiring intervention
- Public reporting of program-wide metrics

**Intervention Tiers (based on performance score):**

| Score  | Rating            | HPD Action                                                                                                                        | Support Level   |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 90-100 | Excellent         | Minimal oversight; eligible for expanded benefits (e.g., TOF refinancing at lower rates)                                          | Self-sufficient |
| 75-89  | Satisfactory      | Standard annual monitoring; continue as planned                                                                                   | Standard        |
| 60-74  | Needs Improvement | Enhanced TA provider engagement; quarterly HPD monitoring; possible corrective action plan                                        | Enhanced        |
| \<60   | At Risk           | Emergency intervention: assigned HPD liaison, intensive TA, weekly check-ins, corrective action plan with 30-60-90 day milestones | Emergency       |

**Last-Resort Enforcement (rarely invoked):**

- Formal notice of violation + 60-day cure period
- Suspension of any future TOF benefits
- Temporary appointment of HPD financial monitor (if financial mismanagement)
- Cooperative receivership (if insolvency threatens member housing)
- Foreclosure and re-acquisition by HPD (absolute last resort; protects affordability)

______________________________________________________________________

## 5.4 Affordability Covenants & Resale Restrictions

### Deed Restriction Language (30-Year Covenant)

**Statutory Reference:** NYC Administrative Code § 26-1807 (Affordability Covenants)

**Key Elements:**

1. **Duration:** 30 years from date of recording; runs with the property in perpetuity (renewal optional)

1. **Eligible Occupants:**

   - Households with income ≤ 80% Area Median Income (AMI) at time of occupancy
   - Annual income recertifications to verify continued eligibility
   - Incumbent members retain occupancy regardless of income growth (grandfathering)

1. **Resale Price Formula:**

   - Member's share value limited to original purchase price + modest appreciation allowance
   - Appreciation capped at 1-2% annually (well below market appreciation)
   - "Residual Receipts Model": 50% of gross building revenue minus operating expenses reserved for reserves/building improvements; member gets only prorated share

1. **Example Resale Scenario:**

   - Member purchased share for $50,000 (1/24th of 24-unit building)
   - After 10 years: Building operating expenses $2.1M/year; gross revenue $2.35M
   - Market price for 1/24th interest: ~$85,000
   - Member allowed to recover: $50,000 (original) + $10,000 (10-year modest appreciation @ 2%) = **$60,000 maximum**
   - Excess $25,000 goes to cooperative capital reserve (permanently securing affordability for future members)

1. **Enforcement:**

   - HPD has right to inspect, audit, enforce covenant
   - Default triggers HPD notice and cure period (60 days)
   - If uncured: HPD may seek specific performance (court order forcing compliance) or damages
   - Right of first refusal: If member attempts to sell above covenant price, HPD/cooperative may force sale at covenant price

1. **Successorship:**

   - If member unable to continue occupancy (death, disability, voluntary exit), share reverts to cooperative
   - Cooperative resells at covenant price to next income-eligible household on waiting list
   - Family succession: Spouse/adult children may assume membership if income-eligible (no price adjustment)

______________________________________________________________________

## 6.3 Tenant Organizing Toolkit (5-Step Model)

### STEP 1: IDENTIFY CORE ORGANIZERS (Weeks 1-2)

**Goal:** Find 3-5 trusted tenants willing to lead organizing

**Activities:**

- Walk building talking to neighbors; listen to concerns
- Identify who are natural leaders (vocal, respected, connected)
- Invite 3-5 to informal coffee/meal to discuss issues
- Assess languages, accessibility needs, conflicts

**Tools & Resources:**

- Informal conversation guide (script)
- Building map and unit list (if available)
- Issue survey (simple 1-page form)

**Key Questions:**

- What are the top 3 issues affecting your building? (heat, heat, repairs, rent, landlord responsiveness, etc.)
- Would you be interested in working with neighbors to address these issues?
- Do you speak English at home? (language access)
- Do you have mobility/accessibility needs for meetings?

**Output:** List of core organizers with contact info, languages, availability

______________________________________________________________________

### STEP 2: BUILD RELATIONSHIPS (Weeks 3-6)

**Goal:** Establish trust; develop shared understanding of issues; grow organizing base

**Activities:**

1. **Door-knock every unit:** 2-3 times during organizing phase

   - Build personal relationships (not just "talking points")
   - Listen deeply to tenant concerns
   - Get contact info (phone, email, preferred language)
   - Invite to first building meeting

1. **Create communication channel:**

   - WhatsApp group (most accessible)
   - Email list (backup)
   - Paper flyers under doors for non-digital tenants

1. **Host informal gatherings:**

   - Potluck in building courtyard/common area
   - Kids' activities (builds family participation)
   - Provides relaxed setting for conversation

1. **Identify shared concerns:**

   - Heat/hot water outages
   - Mold and water damage
   - Inadequate maintenance
   - Rent increases
   - Landlord harassment
   - Fear of displacement

**Tools & Resources:**

- Door-knock script (translated)
- Building flyer template (multilingual)
- WhatsApp/email setup guide
- Potluck planning checklist

**Key Principle:** "People organize around their own issues, not yours." Frame TCAP only after tenants identify building problems and express interest in solutions.

**Output:** Contact list of 50%+ of building; identified shared issues; communication channels established

______________________________________________________________________

### STEP 3: HOLD FIRST BUILDING MEETING (Week 7)

**Goal:** Build collective understanding; make collective decisions; establish organization structure

**Preparation (2 weeks before):**

- Choose accessible location (community room, local church, park near building)
- Provide childcare (hire or recruit volunteer)
- Provide food (pizza, snacks)
- Translate materials into building languages
- Invite supportive partners (legal aid, TCAP staff, TA provider)
- Publicize: flyers, texts, emails, word-of-mouth (target 75%+ attendance)
- Arrange interpretation if 20%+ of tenants speak non-English language

**Meeting Agenda (90 minutes):**

| Time      | Activity               | Notes                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 6:00-6:15 | Welcome & Icebreaker   | Establish tone of respect; introduce facilitator     |
| 6:15-6:30 | Introductions          | Each tenant: name, apt, one hope for building        |
| 6:30-6:50 | Ground Rules           | Respect, confidentiality, one mic, step up/step back |
| 6:50-7:20 | Share Stories          | "What brought you here today?"; listen to issues     |
| 7:20-7:40 | Identify Common Themes | Facilitator synthesizes shared concerns              |
| 7:40-8:00 | Vision for Building    | "What would a healthy building look like?"           |
| 8:00-8:10 | Dot Vote on Priorities | Tenants vote on top 3 issues to address              |
| 8:10-8:20 | Forms of Organization  | Discuss: tenant association, leadership, structure   |
| 8:20-8:25 | Next Steps & Closing   | Next meeting date; celebration/commitment            |

**Facilitation Tips:**

- Use trained, neutral facilitator (from legal aid or TA organization)
- Ensure interpretation is high quality (professional interpreters if possible)
- Physical arrangement: circle or small groups (not classroom style)
- Create space for quieter voices to speak
- Don't pressure consensus; use dot voting to move forward

**Post-Meeting:**

- Send thank-you text/email to all attendees
- Share meeting notes (summarize issues, decisions, action items)
- Follow up with people who couldn't attend
- Set up regular meeting schedule (e.g., 2nd Tuesday of each month, 6 PM)

**Output:** 50%+ tenant attendance; identified shared issues; commitment to next steps; formation decision made

### STEP 5: TAKE ACTION & BUILD MOMENTUM (Ongoing)

**Goal:** Achieve early wins; build power; prepare for TCAP conversion

**Early Wins Strategy:**

Choose initial campaigns that are:

- **Winnable:** Realistic to achieve within 3-6 months
- **Widely Felt:** Affects significant majority of tenants
- **Capacity-Building:** Strengthens organization and member confidence

**Example Campaigns:**

**Campaign 1: Heat Petition**

- Document heat violations (dates, temperatures)
- Gather all tenant signatures demanding repairs
- Deliver petition to landlord (with legal letter)
- File complaint with HPD if landlord non-responsive
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
- **Win:** Functioning heat system by winter

**Campaign 2: Rent-for-Repairs**

- Tenants set aside 10% of monthly rent into escrow account
- Account managed by tenant association treasurer
- Rent released only when repairs completed to tenant satisfaction
- (Legal risks; only with experienced legal counsel)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months
- **Win:** Major repairs completed; landlord gets paid

**Campaign 3: Public Pressure**

- Media outreach (pitch story to local press)
- Rally at HPD or landlord office
- Community board testimony
- City Council member engagement
- **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
- **Win:** Public pressure + political attention forces action

**Campaign 4: TCAP Conversion**

- After 6-12 months organizing, tenant association is strong
- Connect with legal services + TA provider
- Apply for TCAP certification (Form TCAP-100)
- Begin acquisition planning
- **Timeline:** 18-30 months to closing
- **Win:** Tenant ownership + long-term affordability

**Escalation Ladder (least to most intensive):**

| Level | Action              | Timeline     | Intensity |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1     | Petition            | 4-6 weeks    | Low       |
| 2     | Delegation          | 2-3 weeks    | Low       |
| 3     | Media campaign      | 6-8 weeks    | Medium    |
| 4     | Rally/demonstration | 1-2 weeks    | Medium    |
| 5     | Rent withholding    | Ongoing      | High      |
| 6     | TCAP conversion     | 18-30 months | Very High |

**Sustaining Momentum (Long-Term):**

- Regular celebrations of victories (no matter how small)
- Share leadership responsibilities (prevent burnout of core organizers)
- Keep members informed through regular newsletters/updates
- Address conflicts early (mediation, not escalation)
- Connect to broader housing justice movement (attend rallies, sign joint statements)
- Succession planning (develop new leaders to replace those who burn out/leave)

- Take photos if applicable (notice on door, conditions)
- Get witness statements from other tenants

**Step 2: If Landlord Takes Adverse Action**

- Collect documentation of adverse action (eviction notice, rent increase, lease non-renewal)
- Note date of protected activity and date of adverse action (within 90 days = presumption)
- Gather evidence of injury (lost wages from eviction, stress, housing instability)

**Step 3: Report to HPD**

- File complaint with HPD via 311 or online
- Provide documentation of protected activity + adverse action
- Request investigation
- Get complaint number for reference

**Step 4: Contact Legal Services**

- Contact Right to Counsel provider (free legal aid)

- Attorney may send demand letter to landlord; negotiate settlement; or file court case

**Step 5: File Court Case (if needed)**

- Claim: illegal retaliation under housing law
- Burden on landlord to prove legitimate reason
- Judge orders damages + injunctive relief if tenant prevails

______________________________________________________________________

## 7.5 Long-Term Sustainability Support

### Post-Year 2 Transition (Cooperative Independence)

**Goal:** By Year 3-5, cooperative operates independently with minimal TA

**Key Milestones:**

- **Year 2 End:** Board fully trained; operations stabilized; reserves healthy
- **Year 3:** Transition to member-led governance; TA becomes consultative only
- **Year 4-5:** Cooperative develops internal expertise; TA ends (or shifts to as-needed)

**TA Provider Role Evolution:**

| Year | Intensity   | Focus                                     | Frequency         |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1-2  | Intensive   | Governance, finance, operations, conflict | 2-3 days/week     |
| 3    | Moderate    | Board development, member engagement      | 1-2 days/week     |
| 4-5  | Light       | Annual retreat, specialized workshops     | Monthly/quarterly |
| 6+   | Maintenance | Drop-in, phone consultation               | As-needed         |

______________________________________________________________________

### Leadership Development & Succession Planning

**Goal:** Develop internal capacity so cooperative doesn't depend on any single leader

**Strategies:**

1. **Mentorship Program:** Experienced board members mentor newer members
1. **Apprenticeship Roles:** Create positions for aspiring leaders (committee chairs, board liaisons)
1. **Cross-Training:** Multiple board members trained in each critical role
1. **Documentation:** Detailed procedures/manuals for each position (so knowledge transfers easily)
1. **Annual Evaluation & Planning:** Assess board capacity; identify gaps; recruit new candidates
1. **Community Leadership:** Encourage members to engage beyond board (committees, working groups, advocacy)

______________________________________________________________________

### Long-Term Financial Sustainability

**Building Healthy Reserves:**

- Target: $5,000-10,000 per unit in operating reserves
- Ongoing contribution: $100-200 per unit per month
- Used only for: emergencies, major repairs, economic downturns (not for operational expenses)

**Capital Planning:**

- Develop 20-year capital plan (major systems replacement)
- Budget annually for capital improvements (to avoid large special assessments)
- Monitor building condition (annual inspections, reserve studies)

**Subsidy Sustainability:**

- Maintain compliance with affordability covenants (ensures ongoing HPD support)
- Track subsidy changes (if federal housing policy shifts)
- Develop contingency plans (if subsidies reduced or eliminated)
- Explore additional revenue streams (if needed): grants, small commercial space rental, laundry fees

**Member Retention & Engagement:**

- Regular member communication and feedback
- Quality maintenance and responsive governance
- Celebrate milestones and successes
- Support members through hardship (financial assistance funds, emergency support)
- Intergenerational integration (older members mentor younger; children participate in meetings)

# CONCLUSION: TRANSFORMING NYC HOUSING POLICY

The **Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP)** represents a transformative reimagining of how New York City deploys its $6.7 billion annual housing subsidy budget. Rather than perpetuating tenant dependence on landlords, TCAP redirects existing subsidies into equity-building instruments that empower low-income tenants to become owners, build wealth, and exercise democratic control over their housing.

## Framing: From Welfare to Equity Investment

Traditional housing subsidies are framed as "welfare" or "entitlements"—temporary, means-tested, creating dependency. **TCAP reframes public housing support as an equity investment**, analogous to:

- Government-backed mortgages (FHA loans)
- Homeownership tax deductions
- Community development tax credits
- Public pension investments

**TCAP is permanent, builds assets, generates returns, and advances racial justice.**

## Evidence-Based Design

TCAP learns from:

- **TIL Failure (1990s):** Why tenant ownership attempts failed; importance of sustained financing, governance support, affordability enforcement
- **HDFC Success (1980s-2000s):** How limited-equity cooperatives preserve affordability across decades
- **Market-Rate Co-ops (NYC):** Proven governance models, financial management practices, member engagement strategies

## Fiscal Sustainability & ROI

- **Year 1-5 Investment:** $1.334B
- **Year 5-10 Savings:** $1.210B (cumulative payback begins Year 7)
- **10-Year Net Benefit:** $2.375B
- **Per-Member Wealth:** $125,000+ per household over 10 years

## Racial Equity Impact

TCAP explicitly targets communities historically excluded from homeownership:

- **Target:** 40% Black/Latino participants (vs. 28% of subsidized population)
- **Geographic:** Prioritize neighborhoods with \<40% homeownership
- **Intergenerational:** Building permanent wealth for families across generations

## Political & Practical Feasibility

TCAP is **politically viable** because it:

- Works within existing subsidy structures (no new tax burden)
- Generates fiscal savings (appeals to fiscal conservatives)
- Advances equity (appeals to progressives)
- Builds power for tenants (appeals to advocates)
- Demonstrates national model (city leadership)

TCAP is **practically feasible** because:

- NYC already has legal framework (cooperative law, subsidy authority)
- CDFIs and credit unions ready to lend
- TA provider ecosystem exists (UHAB, legal aid, etc.)
- Task Force model ensures coordination
- Pilot phase allows learning and course correction

## Next Steps: Immediate Actions (2026)

1. **Legislative Introduction:** Submit Local Laws A-D to City Council (February 2026)
1. **Public Engagement:** Hold hearings, community forums, stakeholder briefings
1. **Bill Passage:** Target spring 2026 enactment
1. **Rulemaking:** Concurrent rulemaking (begins before legislation passes)
1. **Staffing & Funding:** Hire Director, core team; appropriate $35M Tenant Opportunity Fund
1. **Property Identification:** Begin data-driven identification of pilot sites
1. **Outreach:** Launch public awareness campaign (multilingual)
1. **Pilot Properties:** First tenant associations forming by Q4 2026

## Vision: Housing as Equity, Not Charity

The foundational reimagining of TCAP is this: **housing subsidies are not charity or entitlements. They are equity investments in human potential and community wealth.**

When a family earning $28,000/year receives an $18,000 annual housing subsidy under TCAP, they're not receiving "welfare." They're receiving capital—no different from a wealthy family receiving a mortgage interest deduction or a corporation receiving tax credits.

Over 10 years, that family accumulates $125,000 in cooperative equity. Over 30 years, that grows to $250,000+. Their children inherit not dependence, but ownership. Their grandchildren inherit not poverty, but wealth.

**That is racial justice. That is economic security. That is the promise of TCAP.**
