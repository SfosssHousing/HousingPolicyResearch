# LOCAL LAW B: SUBSIDIZED LIMITED-EQUITY COOPERATIVE (SLEC) CLASSIFICATION

## Legislative Text (Draft)

______________________________________________________________________

## BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding a new chapter 19 of title 26 to read as follows:

# CHAPTER 19: SUBSIDIZED LIMITED-EQUITY COOPERATIVES (SLEC)

## § 26-1901 Purpose

This chapter establishes a classification of Subsidized Limited-Equity Cooperatives (SLECs) within the City's housing taxonomy, aligning tax treatment, oversight authority, and corporate law recognition with TCAP's design under Local Law A, enabling cooperatives to operate efficiently within existing regulatory frameworks while maintaining permanent affordability and member control.

## § 26-1902 Definition of SLEC

An SLEC is a limited-equity housing cooperative organized under New York Cooperative Law § 1801–2000 that meets all of the following:

(a) Has adopted and recorded a TCAP affordability covenant as defined in Local Law A § 26-1807.

(b) Limits member resale rights to prices calculated via an HPD-approved formula, preserving affordability while allowing moderate appreciation.

(c) Maintains member carrying charges at no more than 15% of household income, funded in part by housing subsidy per Local Law A.

(d) Provides democratic governance with one member–one vote and annual member assembly.

(e) Is designated by HPD as an SLEC meeting these standards.

## § 26-1903 Property Tax Treatment and Assessment

(a) **Eligibility for Relief**: An SLEC may apply to the Department of Finance (DOF) for assessment classification and property tax relief comparable to existing HDFC (Housing Development Fund Corporation) and Mitchell-Lama cooperative programs.

(b) **Assessment Methodology**: Buildings shall be assessed by DOF based on affordability-restricted use value, not market-rate comparables. Assessments shall reflect:

(1) Below-market carrying charges resulting from member affordability caps.

(2) Permanent affordability covenant restricting resale and limiting appreciation.

(3) Limited equity structure preventing speculative value extraction.

(c) **Relief Programs**: DOF may grant SLECs:

(1) Reduced assessment classification comparable to HDFC or Mitchell-Lama programs (typically resulting in 25–50% property tax reduction).

(2) Exemption of a portion of assessed value reflecting affordability restrictions.

(3) Abatement schedule for buildings undergoing renovation (e.g., 421-a or 485-x equivalent phased relief).

(d) **Continuing Eligibility**: Tax relief eligibility is conditioned on HPD's continued certification of the cooperative as an SLEC. Loss of TCAP affordability covenant, member control, or compliance standards shall result in DOF reassessment at market value.

(e) **Annual Certification**: HPD shall annually certify to DOF the SLEC status of each building; DOF shall adjust assessments accordingly.

## § 26-1904 Cooperative Formation Standards

(a) **Incorporation**: An SLEC shall be incorporated as a business corporation under New York Cooperative Law § 1801–2000, with Articles of Incorporation filed with the New York Secretary of State.

(b) **Required Provisions in Articles and Bylaws**: Articles of Incorporation and bylaws shall include:

(1) **One Member, One Share, One Vote**: Each member holds one share (one dwelling unit) and has one vote in all membership decisions.

(2) **Board Structure**: Board of Directors (typically 5–7 members) elected annually by member vote; board composition shall reflect member diversity.

(3) **Member Assembly**: Annual meeting required; special meetings convened upon petition by 25% or more of members; quorum requirement typically 50% of members.

(4) **Supermajority Requirements**: Amendments to bylaws, dissolution, major capital assessments, and other material changes require supermajority vote (typically 2/3 or 3/4 as specified in bylaws).

(5) **Affordability Permanence**: Any amendment attempting to remove, weaken, or terminate affordability protections, member equity accounts, or democratic governance shall be null and void; affordability covenants are non-amendable except to strengthen protections or extend duration.

(6) **Dissolution Clause**: Upon dissolution, remaining assets (after payment of debts) shall revert to a community land trust, nonprofit, or entity designated by HPD to preserve affordability in perpetuity, not be distributed to individual members.

(c) **Proprietary Lease**: Each member receives a proprietary lease (occupancy agreement) specifying:

(1) Exclusive right to occupy the assigned unit for duration of membership.

(2) Carrying charge payment obligation, capped at 15% of income, indexed annually.

(3) Building rules and regulations, applied consistently and non-discriminatorily.

(4) Term coincident with cooperative's existence, renewable annually or perpetually.

(d) **Stock Certificate**: Member receives a stock certificate representing one share (typically non-transferable except by inheritance) and the associated proprietary lease.

## § 26-1905 Bylaw Template and Standards

(a) **HPD Template Development**: HPD shall develop and make publicly available a model bylaw template for SLECs, covering:

(1) **Governance Structure**: Board composition, election procedures, term limits, officer roles, committee structure (finance, admissions, grievance).

(2) **Financial Management**: Annual budget approval, carrying charge determination and member notification, reserve fund policy, capital planning, audit requirements.

(3) **Member Rights**: Admission standards, income verification, member communication, voting procedures, grievance resolution.

(4) **Affordability Enforcement**: Resale formula, transfer approval, covenant compliance certification, member equity accounting.

(5) **Amendment Procedures**: Voting thresholds (supermajority), prohibited amendments, notice requirements.

(b) **Adoption and Flexibility**: Cooperatives may adopt the template as-is or adapt it with HPD approval. Any adaptation must maintain consistency with Local Law A (TCAP core principles) and must not weaken affordability, equity, or democratic governance standards.

(c) **Language Access**: All bylaws, policies, and member communications shall be provided in English and in other languages spoken by 10% or more of members.

## § 26-1906 HPD Oversight and Certification

(a) **Certification Authority**: HPD shall designate cooperatives as SLECs upon verification that:

(1) Cooperative has adopted and recorded TCAP affordability covenant.

(2) Cooperative bylaws comply with § 26-1904 standards.

(3) Members have completed income verification and governance training.

(4) Cooperative has established member equity accounts per Local Law A.

(b) **Annual Recertification**: HPD shall recertify SLEC status annually, conditional on ongoing compliance with affordability and governance standards. Cooperatives shall submit:

(1) Annual financial audit by independent CPA.

(2) Member equity account verification.

(3) Compliance self-certification (Form TCAP-300).

(c) **Decertification**: HPD may decertify an SLEC if:

(1) Affordability covenant is removed or violated.

(2) Member equity accounts are depleted or improperly used.

(3) Democratic governance procedures are circumvented.

(4) Discriminatory practices are documented.

Decertification results in loss of tax relief and increased oversight.

## § 26-1907 Implementation and Effective Date

This chapter shall become effective upon enactment and shall apply to all SLECs formed or certified after the effective date.
