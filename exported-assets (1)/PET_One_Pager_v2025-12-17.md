# Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework

## One-Page Executive Summary – v2025-12-17

______________________________________________________________________

## The Problem

NYC spends **$4–5 billion annually** on rental subsidies (CityFHEPS, FHEPS, Section 8) serving ~300,000 low-income households. Yet these subsidies **produce zero resident wealth**: households remain renters with no housing security, no equity, and perpetual eviction risk. Result: ~95,000 evictions annually; 64,000 persons in city shelter (~$3B annual cost); record youth homelessness.

**Why subsidy-only fails:** Temporary assistance prevents immediate displacement but leaves households with zero assets, zero collective power, zero intergenerational stability.

## The Solution: Public Equity Transfer (PET)

**Redirect existing subsidy into resident equity—no new city spending.**

| Current Model (CityFHEPS)                   | PET Model                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| City pays landlord $840/month (70% of rent) | City pays coop $665/month (70%) + equity account $175/month (30%) |
| Household pays $400/month (30% of rent)     | Household pays $400/month (unchanged)                             |
| Household wealth after 10 years: **$0**     | Household wealth after 10 years: **$28,800**                      |

**How it works:**

1. Household enters PET via DSS/Homebase intake (same eligibility as CityFHEPS).
1. HPD matches household to resident-controlled cooperative or community land trust.
1. Household signs equity-share agreement; Right-to-Counsel attorney reviews (free).
1. HRA splits CityFHEPS payment: 70% to coop (rent), 30% to household equity account.
1. Monthly: household accumulates $200–300/month in equity while paying same rent as before.
1. After 5–10 years: household can buy full cooperative share (using equity as down payment) or pass inherited share to children (at controlled low-income prices forever).

## Key Numbers

| Metric                             | Pilot 1 (60 households, 10 years) | Scaled (5,000 households) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **City subsidy redirected**        | $1.8M annually                    | $15M annually             |
| **Household equity accrued**       | $28,800 each                      | $25,000–35,000 each       |
| **Evictions prevented**            | 40–48 people                      | 4,000–5,000 people        |
| **Shelter cost avoided**           | $500,000                          | $50M                      |
| **City net savings (10-year NPV)** | **$1.1M**                         | **$90M**                  |

## Why PET Works

✅ **Budget-neutral:** Redirects existing subsidy (no new appropriation).\
✅ **Permanent affordability:** Article XI low-income deed restriction protects housing forever.\
✅ **Resident control:** Cooperative boards run buildings; members have votes + power.\
✅ **Eviction prevention:** Residents with equity stake are less likely to lose housing; collective action via coop board.\
✅ **Wealth building:** 10-year household equity $25k–$50k; heritable to children (intergenerational benefit).\
✅ **Legal roadmap:** Uses existing NY PHFL Article XI + minor NYC Code amendments.\
✅ **Civil-rights protected:** Mandatory racial equity impact statement; Right-to-Counsel for all members; SOI + Title VI/ADA/504 compliance built-in.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Federal subsidy cut (Section 8) | Cap reliance ≤50% of household debt; PET Emergency Reserve Fund buffers cuts                         |
| Tenant governance failure       | 8–12 week pre-conversion training; HPD coordinator; ongoing Right-to-Counsel support                 |
| Article XI perpetuity concerns  | Transparent disclosure of "controlled-appreciation" model; successor buyout pathways                 |
| Racial equity disparate impact  | Mandatory equity impact statement; stratified random pilot selection; disaggregated annual reporting |
