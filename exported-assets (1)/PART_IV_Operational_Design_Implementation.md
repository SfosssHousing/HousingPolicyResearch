## 4.1 HPD TCAP Unit Structure and Staffing

### 4.1.1 Organizational Placement Within HPD

The Public Equity Transfer Framework requires a dedicated TCAP unit operating within HPD's Office of Development, reporting to the Deputy Commissioner of Development while maintaining coordination lines to the Office of Legal Affairs, Office of Asset and Property Management, and Office of Policy & Strategy.[web:214][web:220]

HPD, as the largest municipal affordable housing developer in the United States, already manages a portfolio of over 200,000 affordable units and coordinates annual spending of approximately $566 million across preservation, new development, and subsidy administration.[web:212] The TCAP unit will leverage existing HPD infrastructure—finance, legal, compliance, regional offices—while introducing specialized cooperative-development capacity.

**HPD's current organizational structure** includes a Deputy Commissioner of Development overseeing eight divisions: New Construction, Preservation Finance, Housing Incentives, Homeownership Opportunities, Preservation & Compliance, Special Needs Housing, and Building and Land Development Services.[web:214] TCAP will be housed as a new specialized division within Preservation Finance, emphasizing the conversion of existing subsidy dollars into member equity.

### 4.1.3 Regional HPD Office Integration

Each of HPD's five borough regional offices—Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island—will assign one regional TCAP liaison (part-time, 0.5 FTE per office) to coordinate local property acquisition, member recruitment, and regional board approval processes.[web:212] These liaisons report to their borough regional director while coordinating with the central TCAP unit on policy and compliance.

---

## 4.2 Interagency Coordination and Memoranda of Understanding

### 4.2.1 Department of Social Services (DSS) / Human Resources Administration (HRA)

HRA already manages 52,000 active CityFHEPS vouchers, spending over $1.1 billion annually, and operates the income verification systems that would support TCAP member determination.[web:213][web:215] For TCAP, DSS/HRA has two primary responsibilities: (1) subsidy allocation to TCAP members, and (2) income verification and ongoing eligibility recertification.

**Subsidy Allocation Mechanics:**
- Each TCAP member is issued a CityFHEPS-equivalent subsidy of $1,800/month ($21,600/year).
- HRA transfers this subsidy directly to the cooperative's account (not to the member), with internal accounting splitting the transfer: 80% to carrying charge, 20% to member equity account.
- Subsidy is indexed annually to building cost inflation (using a proxy: median rent increase announced by the Rent Guidelines Board), ensuring the 80/20 split maintains adequate carrying charge support.

**Income Verification & Recertification:**
- TCAP members are subject to annual income recertification using HRA's existing Asset Verification System (AVS), which automatically verifies bank accounts, employment income, and assets.[web:213]
- If a member's income exceeds 50% of Area Median Income (established at entry), the member remains eligible for the subsidy; if income exceeds 80% AMI, the member's affordability cap rises to 20% of income (allowing equity to continue accruing but at reduced subsidy impact).
- HRA provides TCAP with quarterly verification reports showing member eligibility status.

**Interagency MOU Provisions:**
- DSS/HRA commits subsidy funding for 10 years (subject to annual budget appropriation).
- TCAP commits to data sharing: quarterly reports on member status (income, payments, equity accumulation); annual compliance audit.
- DSS/HRA and HPD jointly develop standardized income verification forms for TCAP enrollment.
- Quarterly coordination meetings between HPD TCAP Director and HRA program management.

### 4.2.2 New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)

NYCHA operates 2,750 developments serving approximately 350,000 residents and has strong institutional relationships with resident organizations, enabling outreach and recruitment for TCAP.[web:212] Additionally, NYCHA's management expertise and capital-planning experience can inform cooperative board training and building maintenance standards.

**TCAP-NYCHA Integration Points:**
- NYCHA residents are priority-eligible for TCAP member recruitment (subject to building availability and member willingness).
- NYCHA provides referrals and outreach support through Resident Associations and NYCHA Community Centers.
- NYCHA staff can nominate experienced resident leaders for cooperative board roles.
- TCAP provides "cooperative basics" training to NYCHA Resident Associations (optional; builds familiarity).
- Potential partnership: NYCHA maintenance staff training for cooperative building operations (as new cooperative buildings come online).

**MOU Provisions:**
- NYCHA designates 1-2 liaison officers for TCAP recruitment and outreach.
- Joint outreach materials developed (in 8+ languages reflecting NYC demographics).
- NYCHA provides resident association contact lists and event access.
- Quarterly meetings between HPD TCAP and NYCHA's Office of Community Engagement.

---

### 4.2.3 Department of Housing and Community Renewal (HCR)

HCR administers state housing programs and tax credits, oversees property finance compliance, and maintains regulatory oversight of affordable housing. For TCAP, HCR's primary roles are (1) compliance monitoring of affordability covenants (if tax credits are used), and (2) coordination on state subsidy or financing programs that might complement TCAP.

**Tax Credit Coordination (if TCAP Cooperatives Use LIHTC):**
- If a cooperative building is financed with federal or state low-income housing tax credits (LIHTC), HCR must monitor compliance with a 30-year (federal) or 15-year (state) affordability requirement.
- TCAP's statutory affordability covenant (30 years, inheritable to member descendants) aligns with federal LIHTC requirements.
- TCAP annually reports to HCR on affordability compliance (percentage of units at/below 50% AMI; rents at/below income-based levels).

**State Programs:**
- HCR's Affordable Housing Program (AHP) provides grants for acquisition and preservation of affordable housing; TCAP applications may be eligible.
- HCR's Homes for New Yorkers program includes cooperative development set-asides; TCAP qualifies for priority consideration.

**MOU Provisions:**
- HCR commits to fast-track compliance monitoring for TCAP properties.
- HCR provides technical assistance on tax credit structures and affordability compliance.
- Annual reporting protocol established (combining TCAP member compliance with tax credit compliance).

---

### 4.2.4 New York City Department of Law (NYC Law)

The Law Department provides legal services to city agencies, reviews legislation, and advises on statutory compliance. For TCAP, the Law Department has two key roles: (1) review of TCAP statutory language and interagency MOUs, and (2) enforcement counsel for affordability covenant violations.

**Legislative Review:**
- NYC Law reviews all four TCAP Local Laws (A-D) for statutory consistency, drafting, and compliance with state law.
- Provides guidance on cooperative law integration with affordability protections.

**Enforcement:**
- If a cooperative violates affordability covenant terms (e.g., attempts to charge above-affordability rents), NYC Law initiates court action to enforce the covenant.
- Cooperatives have right to cure mechanism (e.g., 30-day notice before enforcement action).

**MOU Provisions:**
- NYC Law commits to afford enforcement priority to TCAP covenant violations.
- TCAP reports all covenant compliance issues to NYC Law within 10 days of discovery.
- Quarterly coordination meetings on enforcement strategy and legal precedent.

---

### 4.2.5 NYC Department of Finance (DOF) & Department of Buildings (DOB)

DOF administers property tax relief programs and manages assessment appeals; DOB enforces building codes and permits new construction. For TCAP, these agencies coordinate on property tax abatement (if applicable) and building code compliance.

**Property Tax Support (Optional):**
- TCAP cooperatives may be eligible for property tax abatement under affordable housing programs (e.g., J-51 abatement for certain renovations).
- DOF coordinates identification of eligible properties and abatement application support.

**Building Code Compliance:**
- Cooperatives must comply with NYC Building Code (Title 27) and Housing Maintenance Code (Title 29).
- DOB coordinates inspections and violations remediation.
- TCAP includes building code compliance as part of post-acquisition oversight.

---

## 4.3 Member Certification and Tenure Security

  - Any other legally protected activity

---

### 4.3.4 Member Governance and Board Structure

Each cooperative is governed by a Board of Directors (typically 5–7 members) elected by the member assembly.[web:225] Board composition reflects member diversity and expertise, with balanced representation across demographics and building roles.

**Board Composition (25-Unit Cooperative Model):**
- President (elected by board from members; 1-year term)

## 4.4 Subsidy Conversion and Member Equity Accumulation Procedures

### 4.4.1 Subsidy Allocation to Cooperative and Member Accounts

TCAP reimagines the flow of $1,800/month in housing subsidy, originally designed to pay private landlords, into a structure that simultaneously funds building operations and builds member wealth.

**Monthly Subsidy Flow (Per Member):**

| Component | Amount | Recipient | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Total CityFHEPS-equivalent | $1,800 | Cooperative | Housing support |
| 80% → Carrying Charge | $1,440 | Cooperative operating account | Building costs (mortgage, tax, insurance, utilities, maintenance, admin) |
| 20% → Member Equity | $360 | Individual member equity account | Ownership stake; wealth building |

**Cooperative Accounting:**
- Cooperatives maintain separate accounting for:
  - Operating account (funded by member payments + subsidy carrying charge)
  - Equity accounts (member-specific; individual balances reported quarterly)
  - Capital reserve account (funded by portion of subsidy or member contributions; ~$30,000/year for 25-unit building)
  - Replacement reserve (for major capital work; drawn from capital reserve)

**Member Payment Obligation (15% Cap):**
- Member's out-of-pocket carrying charge payment = 15% of verified annual household income (≤ $1,289/month in Year 1)
- Total building cost to member: $1,289/month (cooperative budgeted per-member cost)
- Member pays: ~$350/month (15% of $28,000 income = $420/year ÷ 12)
- Subsidy covers remaining $939/month (via 80% $1,440 subsidy minus other cooperative revenues)

**Annual Subsidy Indexing:**
- Cooperative calculates building cost inflation using Rent Guidelines Board PIOC or CPI
- If building costs rise 2.5%, subsidy increases to $1,845/month (maintaining real adequacy)
- Member payment may rise, but stays capped at 15% of income
- Formula: If income rises 1.5%, member payment rises ~$60/year; if building costs rise 2.5%, subsidy increases ~$45/year

---

### 4.4.2 Member Equity Account Mechanics and Transparency

Member equity is both an accounting item (balance sheet record) and a real asset (convertible to cash via resale or refinancing).

**Member Equity Account Structure:**

| Annual Component | Amount (Year 1) | Compounding |
|---|---|---|
| 20% subsidy share (monthly @ $360) | $4,320 | Credited monthly; earns no interest (by design; avoids financial institution complications) |
| Member's share of mortgage principal paydown | ~$800–1,200 | Increases over time as amortization accelerates |
| Building appreciation (optional; not counted in base model) | $0–3,000 | Excluded from model; recognized if building appraised above acquisition cost |
| **Cumulative equity (Year 1)** | **~$13,165** | Grows each year; visible on quarterly statement |

**Member Equity Reporting:**
- Quarterly statements mailed to each member (paper or electronic)
- Showing:
  - Beginning balance
  - YTD subsidy credits
  - YTD principal paydown
  - Current balance
  - Year-end projected balance
- Annual audit verifies accuracy of equity balances
- Member can request account review anytime; explanation provided by cooperative

**Member Equity Rights:**
- Member owns equity; cooperative holds it in trust
- Equity is non-forfeitable (survives member departure or cooperative dissolution)
- Equity can be:
  - **Inherited:** Upon member death, heir receives equity and option to remain member or receive cash
  - **Received as resale proceeds:** If member leaves cooperative, receives pro-rata share of sale proceeds above mortgage
  - **Used for refinancing:** If cooperative refinances, members receive equity release (e.g., if building refinances at lower rate, equity distributed)

---

### 4.4.3 Carrying Charge (Housing Payment) Structure and Adjustment

The "carrying charge" is the cooperative's term for the housing payment; it includes mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance, and administration.

**Year 1 Carrying Charge (25-Unit Cooperative):**

| Component | Annual | Per-Member Annual | Per-Member Monthly |
|-----------|--------|---|---|
| Mortgage (P&I) | $68,772 | $2,751 | $229 |
| Property Tax | $83,295 | $3,332 | $278 |
| Insurance | $37,500 | $1,500 | $125 |
| Utilities | $19,500 | $780 | $65 |
| Maintenance | $62,500 | $2,500 | $208 |
| Administration | $85,000 | $3,400 | $283 |
| Capital Reserve | $30,000 | $1,200 | $100 |
| **Total** | **$386,567** | **$15,463** | **$1,289** |

**Carrying Charge Adjustment Process:**
- Annually, cooperative board prepares budget for following year
- Budget includes inflation for each component (typically 2–3% for most items)
- If budget requires increase, board proposes new carrying charge
- Proposal submitted to member assembly for vote (majority required)
- Member's carrying charge payment obligation:
  - Member pays 15% of income (capped)
  - Subsidy covers remainder (80% of $1,845/month in Year 2, as subsidy is inflation-indexed)
  - Member burden never rises due to building cost inflation

**Example (Year 2):**
- Building costs rise 2.5% → new total cost $396,231
- Per-member cost: $15,849/month
- Member income rises 1.5% → $28,420
- Member's 15% obligation: $356.25/month
- Subsidy required: $1,492.75 + $1,429.50 = ... actually, subsidy rises to $1,845 to account for inflation
- Member still pays ~$356; subsidy adjustment absorbs cost increase

## 4.5 Financing Architecture and Capital Sourcing

### 4.5.1 Acquisition Financing Structure

A typical 25-unit TCAP building acquisition requires $1.5 million in purchase price, funded through three sources: member down payments (leveraged via TCAP subsidy), Tenant Opportunity Fund (acquisition loan), and permanent conventional financing.

**Financing Stack (25-Unit Building, $1.5M Acquisition):**

| Source | Amount | Terms | Repayment |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Member Down Payment** | $300,000 | — | Converted to equity; no repayment |
| **Tenant Opportunity Fund** | $600,000 | 3–5% interest; 20-year amortization | From cooperative cash flow |
| **Conventional Mortgage** | $600,000 | 4.0% fixed; 30-year amortization | From carrying charge revenue |
| **Total** | **$1,500,000** | — | — |

**Member Down Payment Subsidy Conversion:**
- TCAP members collectively contribute ~$8,000 in initial down payment (from redirected subsidy and modest savings)
- Total of 25 members × $8,000 = $200,000 (achievable if members are coached on saving)
- HPD provides additional $100,000 from preservation fund or grant (discretionary)
- Total member + HPD = $300,000 (20% down payment)

**Tenant Opportunity Fund (TOF) Acquisition Loan:**
- TOF, administered by NYC and supported by state funding, provides below-market financing for member-led acquisitions
- $600,000 at 3.5% over 20 years = $3,390/month payment
- Amortized as part of cooperative's carrying charge
- Forgiveness possible if affordability maintained; partial forgiveness if building remains affordable 15+ years

**Conventional Permanent Financing:**
- $600,000 mortgage at 4.0% over 30 years = $2,865/month principal & interest
- Requires mortgage commitment from credit union or community bank (NYC-based preferred)
- May require personal guarantees from board members (or guaranty fund)
- Amortized over 30 years; balance forgiven or refinanced as building appreciates

**Total Monthly Debt Service:** $3,390 (TOF) + $2,865 (mortgage) = $6,255/month ($250/member)

---

### 4.5.2 Member Down Payment Accumulation and Assistance

Member down-payment subsidy is distinct from the ongoing carrying charge subsidy; it enables member equity entry and cooperative capitalization.

**Down Payment Subsidy Mechanism:**
- Each member's initial equity stake ($8,000) is funded through:
  - Year 1 redirected subsidy: 20% of $1,800/month = $360 × 12 months = $4,320
  - Year 1 savings match: HPD provides 1:1 match for any member savings contribution (up to $2,000) = up to $2,000
  - HPD preservation fund (discretionary): up to $1,680/member fill-in funding
  - **Total per member: $8,000**

**Savings Match Program (Optional):**
- Members are encouraged to save for down payment during pre-acquisition phase
- TCAP program provides 1:1 match (up to $2,000/member) for verified savings
- Savings held in escrow account; released at closing
- Incentivizes member commitment and builds financial literacy

**Collective Down Payment Goal:**
- 25 members × $8,000 target = $200,000
- If member savings + match = ~$100,000
- TCAP subsidy redirection + HPD fill-in = $100,000
- Total = $200,000 (20% down payment)

### 4.5.3 Bridge Financing and Subsidy Flow During Acquisition Phase

Between contract signing and closing (typically 90–180 days), there is a timing gap: members need down payment capital before mortgage funding is released, but subsidy income doesn't begin until occupancy.

**Bridge Financing Solutions:**

1. **Escrow Hold:** Down payment funds held in escrow with title company; released at closing
2. **Member Equity Bridge:** HPD advances member down-payment subsidy redirects before closing (repaid from closing proceeds)
3. **TOF Draw Schedule:** Tenant Opportunity Fund disburses in tranches tied to closing timeline
4. **Conventional Mortgage Commitment:** Lender commits to fund on closing date; no interim draws

**Timing Example (18-Month Acquisition Timeline):**

| Month | Event | Down Payment Status | Subsidy Flow |
|-------|-------|---|---|
| 0 | Member association forms | Savings accumulation begins | HPD provides educational TA |
| 3 | Contract signed | Members' savings + matches accumulated ($100K) | TBD; pending financing approval |
| 6 | Financing approved | Down payment subsidy redirects committed ($100K from TCAP) | Subsidy not yet flowing (closing pending) |
| 9 | Due diligence completed | Combined $200K committed; held in escrow | Subsidy not yet flowing |
| 12 | Board approval obtained | Ready for closing | Subsidy commitment confirmed with DSS |
| 15 | Inspection/appraisal complete | Appraisal finalizes value | Subsidy conversion mechanics finalized |
| 18 | Closing | Down payment released from escrow; members receive initial equity statements | **Subsidy begins flowing ($1,800/month to cooperative)** |

## 4.6 Post-Acquisition Oversight and Compliance Monitoring

### 4.6.1 HPD Compliance Framework

Following member occupancy and official cooperative transfer, the TCAP cooperative enters a 30-year compliance monitoring period.[web:220] HPD's Office of Asset and Property Management (APM) coordinates oversight, with TCAP's Compliance Officer handling day-to-day coordination.

**Annual Compliance Obligations:**

1. **Financial Audit** (external CPA; provided annually)
   - Cooperative's financial statements reviewed by independent auditor
   - Audit confirms:
     - Adequate reserves for capital replacement
     - No misappropriation of member equity
     - Subsidy used only for member affordability support
     - Carrying charges conform to TCAP affordability cap

2. **Affordability Compliance** (HPD TCAP Compliance Officer)
   - Verify all members remain within 50% AMI (at entry) or ≤80% AMI (after income growth)
   - Confirm carrying charges do not exceed 15% of member income
   - Confirm no members have been displaced or charged above-affordability rates
   - Verify no building has been converted to market-rate or sold without affordability protections

3. **Member Equity Compliance** (HPD TCAP Compliance Officer)
   - Verify member equity accounts receive 20% of subsidy correctly
   - Verify principal paydown is properly credited
   - Confirm annual statements provided to all members
   - Confirm member equity is non-forfeitable and inheritable

4. **Governance Compliance** (HPD TCAP Compliance Officer + APM)
   - Verify board meets monthly and maintains minutes
   - Confirm annual member meetings held
   - Verify major decisions (assessments, bylaw changes, capital projects) receive member approval
   - Confirm board members have completed governance training

5. **Building Maintenance** (HPD Code Enforcement + APM)
   - Capital reserve studies completed every 3–5 years
   - Major repairs (roof, boiler, façade) tracked and budgeted
   - NYC Housing Maintenance Code compliance (heat, hot water, habitability)
   - Any code violations remedied within required timeframes

6. **Racial Equity Outcome Monitoring** (HPD TCAP Director)
   - Verify 40%+ Black and Latino membership maintained (at lease-up and annually)
   - Track member income demographics (median household income, income by race/ethnicity)
   - Report on wealth accumulation by race (equity building disparities monitored)
   - Document any changes in member composition due to turnover

---

### 4.6.2 Cooperative Governance Self-Certification

To reduce compliance burden, cooperatives submit annual "TCAP Self-Certification" form (Form TCAP-300) certifying compliance with affordability and governance requirements. Cooperatives are required to:

- Maintain affordability of all units (15% carrying charge cap or affordability covenant amount)
- Maintain separate member equity accounts and provide annual statements
- Hold annual member meetings with attendance threshold met
- Conduct annual audit by independent CPA
- Report any member income exceeding thresholds or departures
- Report any building code violations and remediation status
- Report any governance disputes or member complaints

HPD spot-checks self-certifications annually; spot-check sample = 20% of cooperatives per year (so each cooperative is checked ~once every 5 years unless problems identified).

---

### 4.6.3 Intervention and Enforcement Procedures

If a cooperative fails compliance obligations, HPD has graduated intervention tools:

**Tier 1: Compliance Notice (90 days to cure)**
- HPD issues written compliance notice documenting violation (e.g., carrying charge charged above cap, insufficient reserves)
- Cooperative is given 90 days to cure
- Cooperative submits remediation plan; HPD monitors
- Examples: Charging above-affordability rent → refund overage; insufficient reserves → board commits to building reserves

**Tier 2: Compliance Order (30 days to cure; public notification)**
- If Tier 1 not cured, HPD issues compliance order (more formal)
- Publicly notified (Council notified; press release optional)
- Cooperative must cure within 30 days or face administrative action
- Examples: Board member removal (by member vote, with HPD supervision); receivership (temporary third-party management)

**Tier 3: Receivership or Forced Refinancing**
- If cooperative unable to cure fundamental issues (insolvency, pervasive governance failure), HPD may petition for receivership
- Receiver (neutral third-party manager) takes control of cooperative pending member vote to restructure
- Rarely used (case law indicates receivership last resort for housing cooperatives)

**Tier 4: Affordability Covenant Enforcement**
- If cooperative attempts to sell or convert away from affordability (violating 30-year covenant), NYC Department of Law enforces covenant in court
- Court can order sale void or require affordability restoration
- Member lawsuit also possible (members are third-party beneficiaries of covenant)
