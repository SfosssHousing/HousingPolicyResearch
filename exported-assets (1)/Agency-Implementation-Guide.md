# PART I: PROGRAM OVERVIEW

## 1. INTRODUCTION AND MISSION

### 1.1 Program Purpose

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) represents a fundamental shift in how New York City delivers housing assistance. Rather than perpetuating tenant dependence on landlord-controlled rental housing, TCAP empowers low-income residents to become collective owners of their buildings through limited-equity cooperatives.

**Core Mission:** Transform public housing subsidies from rent payments into equity-building instruments that generate wealth, promote housing stability, and advance racial and economic justice.

### 1.2 Program Goals

**Primary Objectives:**
- Convert distressed rental properties into tenant-owned cooperatives
- Redirect $500M+ in annual subsidies to equity generation over 10 years
- Create 2,000+ cooperative housing units citywide by 2035
- Reduce shelter system utilization by 15% among program participants
- Close homeownership gaps for Black and Latino households
- Institutionalize democratic tenant governance models

**Secondary Objectives:**
- Improve building conditions and reduce code violations
- Stabilize neighborhoods facing displacement pressure
- Generate fiscal savings through reduced emergency housing costs
- Create replicable model for national adoption

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

1. **Tenant Empowerment:** Tenants lead the process, with city agencies playing supportive roles
2. **Voluntary Participation:** No tenant is forced to participate or lose housing
3. **Racial Equity:** Prioritize communities historically excluded from homeownership
4. **Long-Term Affordability:** Maintain 30+ year affordability commitments
5. **Financial Sustainability:** Ensure cooperatives have resources to succeed
6. **Democratic Governance:** Support tenant control and decision-making
7. **Interagency Collaboration:** Seamless coordination across agencies
8. **Transparency and Accountability:** Public reporting and stakeholder engagement

### 1.4 Target Population

**Eligible Tenants:**
- Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher holders
- CityFHEPS recipients
- HASA rental assistance recipients
- Other city/state subsidy program participants
- Households at or below 80% Area Median Income
- Current tenants of eligible properties

**Priority Populations:**
- Households in buildings with chronic code violations
- Tenants facing displacement risk
- Communities with low homeownership rates
- Buildings with organized tenant associations
- Properties identified by 100 Worst Landlords List
