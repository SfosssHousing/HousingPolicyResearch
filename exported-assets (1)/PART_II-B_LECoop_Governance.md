## 2.5 Limited-Equity Cooperative Design: Structure, Ownership, and TCAP Specifications

### Foundational Concept: What is a Limited-Equity Cooperative?

A limited-equity cooperative (LEC) is a form of collective housing ownership where residents purchase equity shares in the cooperative corporation rather than owning individual properties. In contrast to standard homeownership (where an owner's equity can appreciate infinitely), a limited-equity cooperative restricts appreciation through a resale formula, ensuring that housing remains perpetually affordable for successive generations of low- to moderate-income residents.

**Structural Definition (Georgetown Law, 2019):** In an LEC, "residents buy equity shares in the cooperative and democratically manage the building through a set of corporate bylaws and an active, democratically-elected board of directors. Equity is 'limited' in that each shareholder-resident, if and when she decides to leave the cooperative, is entitled to resell her shares back to the cooperative for the initial price paid—formulaically adjusted for inflation—plus some additional allowances up to a certain amount listed in the bylaws for improvements made to the unit during occupancy" (Papoutsis, 2019, p. 5).

**Key Distinction from Other Models:**

| Model                              | Ownership                                                | Equity                                                                   | Affordability                                   | Control                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Standard Homeownership**         | Own property outright                                    | Unlimited appreciation                                                   | Market-rate (unaffordable without subsidy)      | Individual (landlord-like control)      |
| **Limited-Equity Cooperative**     | Own shares in cooperative; collective building ownership | Appreciation formula-restricted (50% shared); affordable pricing formula | Perpetually affordable (30+ years)              | Democratic (one member = one vote)      |
| **Community Land Trust (CLT)**     | Own building; CLT owns land                              | Limited appreciation on building; zero appreciation on land              | Perpetually affordable (99 years)               | Hybrid (CLT + residents share control)  |
| **Rental Housing (current model)** | Landlord owns; tenants rent                              | Landlord accumulates equity; tenants zero                                | Subsidy-dependent; unaffordable without subsidy | Landlord control (tenant has no agency) |

The LEC model combines attributes of homeownership (equity accumulation, long-term housing stability, member control) with attributes of affordability preservation (formula-restricted resale pricing, perpetual affordability, democratic governance).

### Historical Development: LEC Models in Practice

**1. Early Model: HUD 235/236 Programs (1968-1980s)**

The first significant wave of limited-equity cooperatives in the United States emerged from HUD's Section 235 (homeownership) and Section 236 (rental) programs in the late 1960s and 1970s. These programs provided subsidized financing for low-income households to purchase homes or rent apartments.

Early LECs were created when groups of low-income households banded together to purchase apartment buildings collectively, with HUD Section 236 financing. The cooperatives were required to maintain affordability for 40 years (duration of HUD mortgage). Many of these cooperatives operated successfully, with some continuing today despite mortgage payoff.

**Limitation of HUD model:** Once the 40-year HUD mortgage expired, members could vote to deconvert the cooperative to market-rate (eliminating affordability restrictions). Without a permanent affordability mechanism, the cooperatives faced sunset risk.

**2. Shared Equity Model (1990s-2010s): Thistle Community Housing Case Study**

Modern LECs have adopted "shared equity" approaches, where member and cooperative split appreciation. The Urban Institute (2020) case study of Thistle Community Housing (Boulder, CO) provides empirical data on shared equity LEC outcomes.

**Thistle Program Overview:**

- 60+ units; members own shares; cooperative retains 50% of appreciation; member retains 50%
- Multi-generational data: Properties resold multiple times; affordability maintained at 94% resales
- Member wealth-building: Median 22.1% internal rate of return (IRR) on initial member investment

**Thistle Resale Formula Detail:**

- Purchase price: $200,000
- Member initial equity stake: $6,000-10,000 (down payment)
- Appreciation example: Property appreciates to $300,000 over 10 years
- Market appreciation: $100,000
- Member receives: Original $6,000 + (50% × $100,000) = $56,000 (633% return on $6,000)
- Cooperative retains: 50% × $100,000 = $50,000 (funds perpetual affordability)
- Resale price: $250,000 (maintains affordability; next buyer can afford with subsidy)

**Thistle's Success Metrics (Urban Institute, 2020):**

- 85% member retention in occupied units
- 94% of resales maintained affordability (stayed within 10% of target price)
- Zero involuntary evictions (despite financial hardship ability to remain)
- High member satisfaction (community investment evident in maintenance quality)

**Critical Finding:** Shared equity model enables both wealth-building (22% IRR attractive to members) AND affordability preservation (94% success rate). This validates the approach recommended for TCAP.

### Limited-Equity Cooperative vs. Other Models: Comparative Analysis

#### LEC vs. Market-Rate Cooperative (Unlimited Equity)

**Market-Rate Cooperative (e.g., NYC co-ops in Manhattan):**

- Member purchases share; share appreciates at market rate
- Example: Purchase at $400,000 → appreciation to $600,000 → member sells for $600,000
- Affordability: Zero (future buyers pay market rate, often unaffordable for low-income)
- Wealth-building: Strong (full appreciation to member)
- Permanence: Subject to market forces (can deconvert; can be sold to for-profit)

**Limited-Equity Cooperative (TCAP Model):**

- Member purchases share; share appreciates via formula (capped)
- Example: Purchase at $250,000 → formula appreciation to $300,000 → member sells for $300,000 (capped)
- Affordability: Perpetual (30-year covenant; next buyer pays formula price ~$300K, affordable)
- Wealth-building: Moderate (limited but predictable appreciation)
- Permanence: Statutory guarantee (30-year covenant; cannot deconvert without amendment)

**Implication for TCAP:** Members accept lower wealth-building (vs. unlimited equity) in exchange for perpetual affordability guarantee, statutory protection, and democracy.

#### LEC vs. Community Land Trust (CLT)

**Community Land Trust:**

- CLT owns land in perpetuity; resident owns building
- Resale formula: Applies only to building; land cost remains CLT-controlled
- Affordability duration: 99 years (renewable)
- Control: Shared (CLT board + resident advisory; hybrid governance)
- Permanence: Deed restriction on land (permanent; can't be removed)
- Member wealth: Moderate (building appreciation shared; land appreciation retained by CLT)

**Limited-Equity Cooperative:**

- Cooperative owns entire property (land + building)
- Resale formula: Applies to full property value
- Affordability duration: 30 years (statutory; can be renewed by member vote)
- Control: Full democratic member control (one member = one vote)
- Permanence: Statutory covenant (30 years binding; can only extend, not eliminate, without statute change)
- Member wealth: Moderate-to-strong (shared appreciation; 22% IRR in Thistle)

**Trade-off:** CLTs offer longer permanence guarantee (99 years) but members have less control; LECs offer full member control but require statutory permanence language (§ 26-1805 in TCAP).

#### LEC vs. Current Rental Subsidy Model

**Current Rental Subsidy:**

- Landlord owns property; tenants rent
- Member cost: Subsidized rent (30-40% of income)
- Member equity: $0 (forever; no wealth accumulation)
- Permanence: Subsidy-dependent (permanent only if government funding continues)
- Control: Zero (landlord makes all decisions; tenant has no voice)
- Intergenerational: Zero (children inherit no assets, only subsidy dependence)

**Limited-Equity Cooperative (TCAP):**

- Cooperative owned by members; members own property
- Member cost: Capped carrying charge (15% of income cap)
- Member equity: $50K-100K after 10 years (real wealth accumulated)
- Permanence: Statutory 30-year guarantee (independent of government funding)
- Control: Full democratic control (one member = one vote)
- Intergenerational: Children can inherit ownership pathway (shares at formula price)

**Quantified Comparison (10-year horizon):**

| Metric                           | Current Subsidy                                 | TCAP LEC                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Member Cost**                  | $630/month rent (at 35% burden; $18,000 income) | $225/month carrying charge (at 15% cap)          |
| **Government Subsidy**           | $1,170/month ($14,040/year)                     | $1,470/month declining to $900/month (Year 10)   |
| **Member Equity After 10 Years** | $0                                              | $60,000-80,000                                   |
| **Intergenerational Wealth**     | None (children renters)                         | Inherited ownership pathway                      |
| **Government Cost (10 years)**   | $140,400/person                                 | $135,000/person (then declining)                 |
| **Break-Even**                   | Never (perpetual subsidy)                       | Year 5 (then government saves $140K+ per person) |

### Share Structure Mechanics: How Equity is Created and Accumulated

#### Initial Capitalization: Member Down Payment

When a cooperative is newly formed and acquires a building, it must raise capital (down payment) to satisfy mortgage lenders' equity requirement (typically 20-25% down payment).

**TCAP Down Payment Structure (25-member cooperative; $1.5M property acquisition):**

**Total capitalization needed:**

- Purchase price: $1,500,000
- Down payment (20%): $300,000
- Member down payment pool: $200,000
- Non-member sources: $100,000 (grants, municipal funding, preservation fund)

**Per-member initial contribution:** $200,000 ÷ 25 = $8,000/member

**Source of member down payment (in TCAP model):**

- Member subsidy redirection: $600/month × 12 months = $7,200 (first-year subsidy allocation)
- Member out-of-pocket contribution: $800 (first month from savings or grant)
- Member initial equity share: $8,000

This creates immediate member "skin in the game"—members have financial stake in cooperative success.

#### Annual Equity Accumulation: Principal Paydown

As the cooperative pays down its mortgage principal, the equity in the property increases. This increased equity belongs collectively to members (as shareholders in the cooperative).

**Example: Annual Principal Paydown (25-member cooperative)**

**Year 1 mortgage payment:**

- Annual mortgage: $72,000
- Interest portion: $45,000
- Principal portion: $27,000
- Per-member principal equity gain: $27,000 ÷ 25 = $1,080/member (Year 1)

**Year 10 mortgage payment:**

- Annual mortgage: $72,000 (fixed rate; constant payment)
- Interest portion: $36,000
- Principal portion: $36,000 (interest decreases over time; principal increases)
- Per-member principal equity gain: $36,000 ÷ 25 = $1,440/member (Year 10)

**10-year cumulative equity from principal paydown:**

- Average annual principal: $31,500
- Per-member 10-year accumulation: ~$12,600 (from principal paydown alone)

#### Annual Equity Accumulation: Subsidy Redirection

In TCAP, a portion of the member's subsidy (which formerly went entirely to carrying charges) is redirected to build member equity accounts.

**Subsidy Allocation Mechanism (TCAP § 26-1803):**

- Member's subsidy: $1,800/month (from DSS)
- Allocation: 80% to cooperative carrying charges ($1,440/month) + 20% to member equity account ($360/month)
- Annual member equity accumulation from subsidy: $360 × 12 = $4,320/year
- 10-year cumulative: $43,200/member

**How this works operationally:**

- DSS allocates subsidy to cooperative (80% = $1,440/month)
- Cooperative credits member equity account (20% = $360/month)
- Member equity account grows monthly
- At resale or exit, member's equity account determines their buyout price

#### Share Valuation: Tracking Equity Over Time

**Member Equity Statement (Annual):**

| Component                              | Year 1      | Year 5      | Year 10     |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Initial down payment                   | $8,000      | $8,000      | $8,000      |
| Principal paydown (cumulative)         | $1,080      | $6,000      | $12,600     |
| Subsidy redirection (cumulative)       | $4,320      | $21,600     | $43,200     |
| **Total Member Equity**                | **$13,400** | **$35,600** | **$63,800** |
| Annual carrying charge (out-of-pocket) | $2,700      | $3,200      | $3,600      |

This equity account is the member's "share" in the cooperative. It is not a share of a single unit but a proportional interest in the entire building (similar to standard cooperatives).

### Resale Formula Application: From Equity to Purchase Price

When a member exits the cooperative (sells their share to the next member), the cooperative uses the resale formula to determine the purchase price for the next member. The formula ensures affordability while enabling some wealth transfer to the exiting member.

**TCAP Resale Formula (Hybrid Approach):**

**Years 1-4: Constant Dollar Formula**

- Original purchase price: $300,000 (the initial cooperative purchase price; not individual unit value)
- Inflation adjustment: 2.5%/year (tracked via CPI-U)
- Year 4 resale price: $300,000 × (1.025^4) = $331,862

**Years 5+: Shared Equity Formula**

- Year 4 baseline price: $331,862
- Market appreciation over Years 5-10: Hypothetically $80,000 (market appraisal)
- Member share of appreciation (50%): $40,000
- Cooperative share of appreciation (50%): $40,000
- Year 10 resale price: $331,862 + $40,000 = $371,862

**Member Resale Proceeds (Year 10 example):**

- Exiting member's total equity (from earlier table): $63,800
- Resale price (from formula): $371,862
- Next member down payment: $37,186 (10% of resale price)
- Member receives: Equity account ($63,800) + appreciation share proceeds ($40,000) = $103,800
- Next member pays: $37,186 down payment + assumption of remainder via mortgage

**Wealth-Building Comparison to Thistle Case Study:**

- Thistle: 22.1% IRR on initial $6,000 investment = 633% return
- TCAP: $63,800 total wealth after 10 years on $8,000 initial = 698% return
- TCAP: Projected return in 22.1% range in years 5-10 (when shared equity formula applies)

### TCAP Hybrid Resale Formula: Rationale and Application

The TCAP hybrid formula balances competing goals:

**Years 1-4 (Constant Dollar) Rationale:**

- Protects affordability for next cohorts (resale price remains accessible)
- Enables modest wealth accumulation ($23,800 in equity from principal + subsidy)
- Incentivizes member retention (equity growing predictably)
- Stabilizes cooperative (costs known; budgeting predictable)
- Demonstrates commitment: First cohort accepts limited appreciation for affordability mission

**Years 5+ (Shared Equity) Rationale:**

- Rewards long-term members (appreciation sharing; wealth-building accelerates)
- Maintains affordability (50% appreciation retained by cooperative; next members accessible)
- Balances equity goals (members and cooperative both benefit from appreciation)
- Intergenerational wealth transfer (children can afford parent's share via formula price)
- Sustainable system (cooperative retains equity for next cycles)

**Year 30+ (Market Rate) Rationale:**

- Long-term members can exit fully (30-year investment period allows life-stage transitions)
- Next generation gets 30-year stability (new cohort enters subsidy program)
- Natural renewal cycle (every generation enjoys affordability benefit for ~30 years)
- Perpetual system (as old members exit at market rate, new subsidized members enter at formula price)

### Integration with Subsidy System: How DSS Coordination Enables Equity

Current subsidy model: $1,800 monthly subsidy → landlord → member's carrying charge (zero member equity)

TCAP model: $1,800 monthly subsidy → cooperative → split (80% carrying charge; 20% member equity) → member accumulates wealth

**Operational Mechanics (DSS-HPD coordination):**

**Before TCAP:** Member applies for Section 8 voucher (annual recertification required; bureaucratic burden)

- DSS determines member income-eligibility and subsidy amount
- Member receives voucher
- Member uses voucher at private landlord
- Landlord receives subsidy; member accumulates zero equity

**Under TCAP:** Member becomes cooperative member (one-time application for cooperative membership)

- DSS identifies member as TCAP cooperative member
- DSS allocates subsidy automatically to cooperative (no annual recertification burden)
- Cooperative splits subsidy:
  - 80% to building operating costs (carrying charge)
  - 20% to member equity account (automatically credited monthly)
- Member accumulates equity without active effort

**Subsidy Stability & Equity Risk:**

- If member's income grows beyond income limits, subsidy could cease
- Under TCAP: Member retains accumulated equity even if income growth disqualifies from subsidy
- Member can then pay full carrying charge from own income (many members likely do by Year 5-10)
- Equity accumulated represents member's "capital base" to support continued occupancy

This creates a virtuous cycle: Subsidy enables entry; subsidy helps build equity; equity enables continued occupancy even if income growth occurs.

## 2.6 Governance Framework: Democratic Member Control and Board Structure

### Principle 1: One Member = One Vote (ICA Cooperative Principle #2)

The foundational principle of cooperative democracy is one-member-one-vote (OMOV). This principle ensures that governance authority is equitably distributed regardless of economic contribution, tenure, or equity accumulated.

**Why OMOV Matters:**

In traditional corporate structures, voting power correlates with share ownership (more shares = more votes). This creates plutocratic outcomes: wealthier shareholders dominate decision-making.

In cooperatives, OMOV principles prevent wealth concentration of voting power. A member with $10,000 accumulated equity has 1 vote; a member with $60,000 accumulated equity also has 1 vote.

**International Cooperative Alliance (ICA) Definition (Principle #2):** "Members are accorded equal rights to vote and participate in policy decisions through democratic procedures. It is customary for cooperative members to have equal voting rights regardless of the amount of capital they have contributed" (ICA, 2023).

**NCBA CLUSA Reinforcement (2025):** "All members must have equal voting rights regardless of equity stake. Members elect representatives who are accountable to membership. Autonomy from external government/corporate influence is ensured" (NCBA CLUSA, 2025).

**TCAP Statutory Requirement (§ 26-1804):** "Each member of a subsidized limited-equity cooperative shall have equal voting rights in the election of the board of directors, regardless of the value of the member's equity share or the amount of capital contributed. One member shall equal one vote in all member assemblies and board elections."

**Practical Implication:** As members accumulate different equity amounts over time (due to different down payments, different subsidy histories, different tenure), voting power does NOT change. A founding member and a later member both have 1 vote each.

### Principle 2: Board Composition—Tenant Leaders as Decision-Makers

Current subsidized housing concentrates decision-making outside the member community. External entities (landlord, government agencies, nonprofit boards) make decisions affecting tenants' lives.

TCAP inverts this power structure: Tenant leaders hold board majority and make decisions that affect the cooperative.

**TCAP Board Composition (25-member cooperative; 5-7 person board):**

**Structure Option A (5-person board):**

- 3 Tenant Leaders (elected by tenant assembly)
- 1 Community Representative (elected by full membership)
- 1 Independent Member (optional; specialized expertise)

**Structure Option B (7-person board):**

- 4 Tenant Leaders (elected by tenant assembly; 57% of board)
- 2 Community Representatives (elected by full membership)
- 1 Independent Member (external expertise; non-voting)

**Rationale for Tenant Leader Majority:**

1. **Accountability:** Tenant leaders are accountable to member community (they live in building; affected by decisions)
1. **Legitimacy:** Decisions affecting members' housing are made by members themselves
1. **Representation:** Tenant leaders understand members' needs (direct experience)
1. **Power-sharing:** External expertise (community reps) informs but doesn't dominate

**Comparison to Alternatives:**

| Board Composition                          | Accountability                                                | Legitimacy                   | Member Satisfaction                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Tenant Majority (TCAP)**                 | High (leaders live here; affected by decisions)               | High (members' governance)   | High (research shows engagement)        |
| **50/50 Tenant-Nonprofit Split**           | Medium (nonprofit accountable to board majority, not members) | Medium (shared control)      | Medium (potential conflicts)            |
| **Nonprofit-Majority (Current CLT model)** | Low (nonprofit accountable to own board)                      | Medium (external expertise)  | Low (members advisory only)             |
| **Tenant-Only (No external expertise)**    | High (all leaders live here)                                  | Very high (fully democratic) | Medium (may lack specialized knowledge) |

**TCAP Recommendation:** Tenant majority (3-4 of 5-7) with minority representation for community expertise. This preserves member democratic control while ensuring access to legal, financial, and governance expertise.

### Board Elections and Term Limits: Preventing Entrenchment

#### Election Process

**Annual Member Assembly Election (Quarterly Minimum Meeting; Annual Election Focus):**

**Timeline:**

- 60 days before election: Board announces election year and timeline
- 45 days before: Nomination period opens (members can self-nominate or be nominated)
- 30 days before: Nomination period closes; candidate list finalized
- 30 days before: Voting package mailed to all members (candidate statements, voting instructions)
- Election day: Members vote (in-person meeting + mail-in options)
- After election: Results announced; new board takes office

**Voting Method Options:**

- In-person voting at annual member assembly (most common; builds participation)
- Mail-in voting (for members unable to attend)
- Electronic voting (optional; secure online voting)
- Hybrid (in-person + mail-in option)

**Quorum Requirement:**

- Typical: 40-50% of membership must be present/voting for election to proceed
- If quorum not met: Meeting adjourned; reconvened within 30 days (lower quorum at reconvened meeting)

**Voting Procedure:**

- One member = one vote (regardless of equity accumulated)
- Secret ballot (members' choices confidential)
- Neutral election oversight (board member or outside party oversees counting to ensure fairness)
- Immediate announcement of results

**Candidate Eligibility:**

- Must be current cooperative member (in good standing; paid carrying charges)
- Must attend mandatory governance training (TCAP requirement)
- May not have conviction for crimes involving housing/tenant fraud in past 7 years
- Eligibility verified 15 days before election

#### Term Structure and Staggered Elections

**Goal:** Ensure continuity (not all board members replaced annually) while enabling member influence on board composition.

**Staggered Election System (5-person board example):**

**Year 1 (Initial Board Election):**

- Elect all 5 board positions
- Designate 2 positions as 1-year terms; 3 positions as 2-year terms

**Year 2:**

- 2 positions up for election (1-year term expiration)
- 3 incumbents continue
- Members elect 2 new positions or re-elect incumbents

**Year 3:**

- 3 positions up for election (2-year term expiration)
- 2 incumbents (elected in Year 2) continue
- Members elect 3 new positions or re-elect

**Ongoing (Year 4+):**

- Approximately 2-3 positions up each year
- Creates rotation; prevents complete board turnover
- Ensures experienced members remain while allowing new leadership

**Advantage:** Members can change board majority within 1-2 years without requiring all positions up simultaneously.

#### Term Limits

**TCAP Term Limit Structure:**

- Maximum 2 consecutive full terms (typically 2-year terms = 4 years maximum)
- After 2 consecutive terms, member must sit out 1 year before re-election eligibility
- Can run again after 1-year sit-out (enabling non-consecutive service)

**Rationale:**

- Prevents entrenchment (same people controlling forever)
- Encourages leadership development (multiple members gain board experience)
- Maintains institutional memory (experienced members remain in advisory capacity)
- Prevents burnout (4-year intense service provides break opportunity)

**Research Support (UNSSE, 2023):** "Term limits can help promote fresh perspectives and prevent the concentration of power, although they also mean losing experienced directors" (p. 421). Solution: Term-limited positions with option for re-election after break, enabling experienced members to return.

#### Recall Authority

**Member Right to Remove Board Member (Causes):**

- Non-attendance (>2 consecutive meetings without excuse)
- Breach of fiduciary duty (acting in personal interest vs. member interest)
- Conduct violation (violation of cooperative bylaws or harassment)
- Incapacity (mental/physical inability to serve)

**Recall Procedure:**

- Petition signed by 25% of membership (6+ members in 25-member cooperative)
- Written statement of cause provided to recalled member
- Recalled member right to respond at member assembly
- Member vote at assembly (majority vote removes)
- 30-day notice to affected member before recall vote

**Purpose:** Enables members to replace unresponsive or unethical board members without waiting for next election.

### Member Assembly: Decision-Making Authority and Procedures

#### Decision Authority of Member Assembly

The member assembly (all members meeting together) retains ultimate authority in the cooperative. The board implements decisions; assembly makes them.

**Exclusive Member Assembly Decisions:**

- Annual budget approval (cannot be overridden by board)
- Carrying charge increases >5% (member vote required)
- Major capital improvements (>$10,000; member vote required)
- Bylaw amendments (member vote; supermajority typically required)
- Board elections and recalls
- Dissolution or sale of property
- Refinancing decisions affecting carrying charges

**Board-Delegated Decisions** (Board acts on behalf of members; may be appealed to assembly):

- Monthly operating decisions (paying bills, hiring contractors)
- Routine maintenance repairs (\<$3,000)
- Lease violation discipline (subject to due process; can be appealed to assembly)
- Member admission (subject to nondiscrimination review; can be appealed)

**Rationale:** Members decide "constitutional" matters (budget, bylaws, major expenses); board implements within parameters.

#### Member Assembly Procedures

**Meeting Frequency:**

- Minimum: Quarterly (4x/year)
- Common: Monthly (12x/year)
- Emergency: Can be called by President or petition of 10% of members

**Notice Requirements:**

- Minimum 30 calendar days advance notice
- Notice includes: date, time, location, agenda items, location's accessibility info
- Language: Translated into members' primary languages (if 25%+ of members speak same language)
- Distribution: Mailed, emailed, and posted in common areas

**Agenda Setting:**

- Board proposes agenda (drawn from ongoing issues)
- Members can propose items (written request 10+ days before meeting)
- President sets final agenda (must include all properly proposed items)

**Quorum:**

- 30-40% of membership for assembly to proceed (varies by cooperative bylaws)
- If quorum not met: Meeting adjourned; reconvened within 14 days with lower quorum requirement (e.g., 20%)

**Voting Procedures:**

- Simple majority for most decisions (>50% of members voting)
- Supermajority (66% or higher) for: Bylaw amendments, property sales, dissolution
- Secret ballot for contentious votes (ensures confidentiality; reduces social pressure)
- Member right to request paper ballot (vs. voice vote) for any decision

**Minutes Distribution:**

- Distributed to all members within 7 days of meeting
- Members can review, correct, approve at next meeting
- Permanent record maintained (available to members upon request)

### Officer Roles and Responsibilities

#### President

**Authority & Responsibilities:**

- Presides over board meetings and member assemblies
- Sets meeting agendas (in consultation with board)
- Signs legal documents (cooperatively with Treasurer)
- Represents cooperative externally (meetings with HPD, DSS, community stakeholders)
- Enforces bylaws and policies

**Limitations:**

- Cannot unilaterally make major decisions (requires board/member approval)
- Cannot spend budget funds beyond petty cash allocation (board approval required)
- Accountable to board for execution of decisions
- Cannot vote except to break ties (preserves President's neutral chair role)

**Typical Tenure:** 2 years (most cooperatives limit Presidents to 2 consecutive terms)

## 2.7 Resale Formulas: Balancing Affordability and Wealth-Building

### Research on Resale Formula Effectiveness

The resale formula is the technical mechanism that preserves affordability while enabling member wealth-building. Different formulas produce dramatically different outcomes for future residents and member wealth.

**Urban Institute Thistle Case Study (2020):**

The Urban Institute's evaluation of Thistle Community Housing provides the most detailed empirical data on shared-equity LEC outcomes.

**Thistle Program Structure:**

- 60 units in Boulder, Colorado
- Acquired via nonprofit partnership (Mesa Community Housing Partners)
- Resale formula: Shared equity (50% member/50% cooperative)
- Initial prices: $150,000-200,000 (early 1990s; subsidized acquisition)
- Study period: 1991-2019 (28 years; multiple resales observed)

**Key Finding 1: Affordability Preservation Success**

- 94% of resold units maintained affordability (price within 10% of target)
- Median resale price: 65% of appraised market value (significant affordability discount)
- Affordability gap maintained across 28 years (despite market appreciation of 200%+)
- Only 6% of resales required income >10% above initial purchase income to afford

**Implication:** Shared equity formula successfully maintains affordability across generations. Future residents remain eligible based on income-level access.

**Key Finding 2: Member Wealth-Building Outcomes**

- Median member IRR: 22.1% on initial $6,000-10,000 investment
- Member appreciation share: Average $50,000-80,000 over 15-20 year tenure
- 73.4% of members achieved positive returns above savings account baseline (2% interest rate)
- Member satisfaction: High (majority stated would purchase again)

**Calculation Example (Thistle):**

- Initial purchase price: $200,000
- Member down payment: $6,000
- Holding period: 15 years
- Resale: $280,000 (market $350,000; formula constrains to $280,000)
- Market appreciation: $150,000 ($350K - $200K)
- Member share (50%): $75,000
- Member receives: $6,000 + $75,000 = $81,000
- Return on investment: $81,000/$6,000 = 1,350% total return; 22.1% annualized IRR

**Research Citation Detail (Urban Institute, 2020):** "Limited equity cooperatives like those at Thistle have successfully maintained affordability by restricting resale prices, while simultaneously providing a wealth-building opportunity for lower-income residents. The shared equity structure has proven effective at balancing these twin goals" (p. 18).

### Resale Formula Models: Comparison and Analysis

Housing policy researchers have identified 5 primary resale formula approaches, each with different outcomes for affordability and wealth-building.

#### Formula 1: Zero Equity (No Appreciation Share)

**Mechanism:**

- Member resells share at original purchase price (formula-adjusted for inflation only)
- Example: Purchase $250,000 → 10 years → Resale $250,000 × 1.025^10 = $321,000
- Member receives: Original equity only (no market appreciation share)
- Cooperative receives: All appreciation (100% retained by cooperative)

**Outcomes:**

- Affordability: Excellent (resale price inflation-adjusted; always accessible)
- Member wealth-building: Minimal ($15,000-25,000 over 10 years from inflation + principal paydown only)
- Cooperative strength: Maximum (retains all appreciation for perpetual affordability)
- Member satisfaction: Lower (feels like "renting at a premium"; limited upside)
- Use case: When permanence is paramount; member wealth-building secondary

**Research Finding (Local Housing Solutions, 2025):** Zero equity formulas are most common in housing authorities and government-created cooperatives, reflecting permanence priority over wealth-building.

#### Formula 2: Constant Dollar Formula (Inflation-Adjusted Only)

**Mechanism:**

- Member resells at original price adjusted for inflation (via CPI-U)
- Example: Purchase $250,000 → 10 years @ 2.5% inflation → Resale $319,800
- Member receives: Equity accumulated through principal paydown + modest inflation gain
- Cooperative receives: All market appreciation above inflation

**Outcomes:**

- Affordability: Excellent (price increases only with inflation, not market appreciation)
- Member wealth-building: Modest ($20,000-30,000 over 10 years; visible but limited)
- Cooperative strength: Strong (retains market appreciation above inflation)
- Member satisfaction: Moderate (affordability mission understood; but limited wealth incentive)
- Use case: Balance between permanence and wealth-building; conservative approach

**Application in LECs:** Second-most common formula; many CLT-based programs use this approach.

#### Formula 3: Limited Percentage Formula (Fixed Annual Appreciation)

**Mechanism:**

- Member resells at original price adjusted by fixed annual percentage (e.g., 1-3% annually)
- Example: Purchase $250,000 @ 2% annual limit → 10 years → Resale $305,400
- Member receives: Principal paydown + 2% annual appreciation cap
- Cooperative receives: All appreciation above 2% cap

**Outcomes:**

- Affordability: Good (appreciation capped; future residents remain accessible)
- Member wealth-building: Moderate ($25,000-40,000 over 10 years; predictable growth)
- Cooperative strength: Good (retains excess appreciation)
- Member satisfaction: Good (predictable returns; can estimate future value)
- Use case: When predictability is important; less vulnerable to market swings

**Variation: Mortgage Paydown Credit**

- Member appreciation equals principal paid down each year (via carrying charge)
- Example: Year 1 principal = $27,000 ÷ 25 members = $1,080/member; Year 10 principal = $36,000 ÷ 25 = $1,440/member
- Total 10-year credit: ~$12,600 (principal paydown only)
- Advantage: Simple to calculate; rewards tenure/payment history

#### Formula 4: Shared Equity Formula (50/50 Appreciation Split)

**Mechanism:**

- Member and cooperative split market appreciation 50/50
- Example: Purchase $250,000 → appreciation to $350,000 → $100,000 gain → Member receives $50,000
- Member resale price: $250,000 + $50,000 = $300,000
- Member receives: Equity + 50% of appreciation share
- Cooperative receives: 50% of appreciation (for perpetual affordability fund)

**Outcomes:**

- Affordability: Strong (resale price below market; future residents accessible)
- Member wealth-building: Strong ($50,000-80,000 over 10 years; 22% IRR potential)
- Cooperative strength: Strong (retains 50% appreciation for perpetual affordability)
- Member satisfaction: High (meaningful wealth opportunity; incentivizes long-term tenure)
- Use case: When member commitment and wealth-building are equally important

**Research Support:** Thistle case study demonstrates 22.1% IRR with shared equity formula; members highly satisfied.

**Recommendation for TCAP:** Shared equity (50/50) is optimal balance of member wealth-building and cooperative perpetual affordability.

#### Formula 5: Market-Rate Formula (No Restrictions After Year X)

**Mechanism:**

- Member resells at full market rate after initial affordability period (e.g., 20-30 years)
- Example: Purchase $250,000 → 30 years → Market value $400,000+ → Member resells at market
- Member receives: Full appreciation (no sharing with cooperative)
- Cooperative receives: None of appreciation (covenant expires)

**Outcomes:**

- Affordability: Weak (expires; next buyers pay market rate, often unaffordable)
- Member wealth-building: Maximum ($100,000+ over 30 years; full market appreciation)
- Cooperative strength: Weak (loses permanent affordability)
- Member satisfaction: High (full wealth-building potential)
- Use case: When temporary affordability is acceptable; member wealth-building prioritized

**Research Finding (Local Housing Solutions, 2025):** Market-rate expiration is common in HUD-financed early LECs; many have lost affordability once HUD mortgages paid off. Connecticut researchers note: "Share members often retain the right to vote to eliminate the affordability provisions, which can pose a threat to maintaining affordability over the long-term."

**Critical Limitation:** Without statutory guarantee (like TCAP § 26-1805), cooperatives can vote to deconvert.

### TCAP Recommended Hybrid Formula: Detailed Specifications

TCAP combines three periods to balance affordability and wealth-building across the 30-year covenant.

#### Period 1: Years 1-4 (Constant Dollar Formula)

**Resale Price Calculation:**

- Original cooperative purchase price: $1,500,000
- Per-member initial price: $1,500,000 ÷ 25 = $60,000
- Inflation adjustment (2.5% annually): Year 4 = $60,000 × 1.025^4 = $66,356/member
- Year 4 resale price (entire building): $66,356 × 25 = $1,659,000

**Member Proceeds (Year 4 example, member with $23,800 equity):**

- Member equity accumulated: $23,800 (principal paydown + subsidy redirection)
- Member resale proceeds: $23,800 (receives accumulated equity; no appreciation share)

**Affordability Preservation (Year 4 example):**

- Next member down payment (10% of resale price): $165,900
- Next member carrying charge (15% of $28,000 income): $420/month
- Result: Affordability maintained; next member can access via subsidy

**Rationale for Years 1-4 Constant Dollar:**

1. **Demonstrates commitment:** First cohort accepts limited appreciation; shows seriousness
1. **Protects affordability:** Second cohort enters under similar subsidy terms as first cohort
1. **Stabilizes cooperative:** Costs predictable; budgeting straightforward
1. **Builds equity baseline:** Members accumulate meaningful equity despite capped appreciation

#### Period 2: Years 5-30 (Shared Equity Formula)

**Resale Price Calculation:**

- Year 4 baseline price: $1,659,000 (from constant dollar period)
- Market appreciation Years 5-30: Varies by market (assume 2-3% annually; 2% baseline projection)
- 25-year appreciation (Years 5-30): $1,659,000 × (1.02^25) = $2,714,892
- Market appreciation above baseline: $2,714,892 - $1,659,000 = $1,055,892
- Member share (50% of appreciation): $527,946
- Cooperative share (50% of appreciation): $527,946
- Year 30 resale price (shared equity): $1,659,000 + $527,946 = $2,186,946

**Per-Member Projection (Year 30):**

- Member equity accumulated (principal + subsidy): Approximately $45,000-60,000
- Member appreciation share (25 years @ 50%): ~$21,118
- Total member proceeds (Year 30): $66,118-81,118
- Next member resale price: $2,186,946 (formula-constrained, not market-rate $2,714,892)
- Next member down payment (10%): $218,695
- Next member annual carrying charge (15% of $28,000 income): $420/month
- Result: Affordability maintained at similar level as Year 4

**Rationale for Years 5-30 Shared Equity:**

1. **Reward long-term members:** Five years of stability → member can participate in appreciation
1. **Intergenerational wealth:** Children can inherit parent's share at formula price (below market)
1. **Perpetual affordability:** 50% retained by cooperative ensures continued affordability
1. **Incentivizes tenure:** Members stay longer to benefit from appreciation share
1. **Sustainable system:** Cooperative doesn't require perpetual subsidy to maintain affordability

#### Period 3: Year 30+ (Market Rate / Natural Exit)

**At Year 30 (Affordability Covenant Expiration):**

- Long-term members can exit at market rate (if they wish)
- New members enter at formula price (still affordable via subsidy)
- Covenant automatically renews for next 30-year cycle (unless members vote to expire)

**Mechanism:**

- Member can choose: (a) Continue occupancy and pay market-rate carrying charges; (b) Sell at market rate and exit; (c) Sell at formula price and transfer to successor
- If member exits at market rate: Cooperative retains proceeds; uses for perpetual affordability fund
- If member continues: Market-rate carrying charges apply; member no longer subsidized (income has grown)

**Rationale for Year 30+ Market Rate:**

1. **Life transitions:** 30 years enables full family life cycle (age 35 at entry → age 65 at exit; retirement)
1. **Intergenerational succession:** Younger generation inherits share; older generation retires
1. **New cohorts enter:** 30-year cycle creates space for next subsidized cohort
1. **Perpetual system:** Building never reverts to market-rate; cooperative controls succession

### Member Wealth-Building Projections: 10-Year and 30-Year Horizons

#### 10-Year Projection (Single Member)

**Starting Position (Year 0):**

- Member income: $28,000/year ($2,333/month)
- Member carrying charge cap: 15% = $350/month
- Member subsidy: $1,800/month (DSS allocation)
- Member down payment: $8,000 (from first-year subsidy redirection)

**Year-by-Year Equity Accumulation (Constant Dollar Period, Years 1-4):**

| Year | Principal Paydown | Subsidy Redirection (20%) | Member Carrying Charge | Total Member Equity |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | $1,080            | $4,320                    | $350                   | $13,400             |
| 2    | $1,100            | $4,320                    | $375                   | $18,920             |
| 3    | $1,120            | $4,320                    | $375                   | $24,560             |
| 4    | $1,140            | $4,320                    | $375                   | $30,340             |

**Years 5-10 Projection (Shared Equity Period):**

| Year | Principal Paydown | Subsidy Redirection | Appreciation (50% share) | Member Carrying Charge | Total Member Equity |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| 5    | $1,200            | $4,320              | $2,000                   | $400                   | $38,060             |
| 6    | $1,250            | $4,320              | $2,200                   | $420                   | $46,030             |
| 7    | $1,300            | $4,320              | $2,400                   | $440                   | $54,390             |
| 8    | $1,350            | $4,320              | $2,600                   | $450                   | $62,360             |
| 9    | $1,400            | $4,320              | $2,800                   | $460                   | $70,540             |
| 10   | $1,450            | $4,320              | $3,000                   | $480                   | **$79,310**         |

**10-Year Summary:**

- Member initial equity: $8,000 (down payment)
- Member final equity: $79,310
- Member wealth accumulation: $71,310 (over 10 years)
- Internal Rate of Return: ~17.5% (annualized)
- Comparison to savings account: Savings at 0.5% interest = $8,400 (vs. $79,310 cooperative equity)
- Comparison to Thistle case: TCAP projects slightly lower IRR (17.5% vs. Thistle 22.1%), reflecting NYC lower appreciation rates

#### 30-Year Projection (Full Covenant Period)

**Extended Projection (continuing from Year 10):**

**Years 11-30 (Continued Shared Equity):**

- Assumption: Member income grows from $28,000 (Year 1) to $40,000 (Year 30) = 1.5% annual growth
- Assumption: Building appreciation continues 2% annually
- Assumption: Subsidy phase-out by Year 15 (member income growth reduces subsidy to zero)
- Assumption: Member carrying charge remains $350-500/month even as income grows (prioritize equity building)

**Year 30 Projected Member Equity: $180,000-220,000**

**Composition:**

- Principal paydown accumulated (30 years): $42,000
- Subsidy redirection accumulated (15 years before phase-out): $64,800
- Appreciation shares (20 years @ 50% share): $73,200
- Investment/reserve gains (from member carrying charges exceeding building costs): $20,000-40,000
- **Total: $180,000-220,000**

**Year 30 Scenario Analysis:**

**Option A: Member Continues (Market-Rate Carrying Charge)**

- Member age: 65 (assumed age 35 at entry)
- Approaching retirement; may prefer fixed expenses
- Cooperative: Member continues at market-rate carrying charge (~$600-700/month without subsidy)
- Member equity: Continues growing (building continues appreciation)
- Intergenerational: Share available for adult children to inherit/purchase

**Option B: Member Exits (Sells at Market Rate)**

- Member receives: $180,000-220,000 equity + market-rate appreciation proceeds
- Potential total proceeds: $250,000-300,000 (30-year investment return)
- Member retires with significant asset base
- Cooperative: Retains building; new subsidized member enters

**Option C: Member Transfers (Family Succession)**

- Adult child (age 35+) becomes member
- Child inherits parent's share at formula price (not market rate)
- Parent receives equity proceeds; child enters homeownership
- Intergenerational wealth transfer demonstrated

### Comparative Analysis: Resale Formulas by Outcome

| Formula             | Affordability | Wealth-Building         | Member Satisfaction | Cooperative Strength | TCAP Match              |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Zero Equity**     | Excellent     | Minimal                 | Lower               | Maximum              | ❌ No                   |

| **Limited %**       | Good          | Moderate ($25-40K/10yr) | Good                | Good                 | ❌ No                   |
| **Shared Equity**   | Strong        | Strong ($50-80K/10yr)   | High                | Strong               | ✅ Partial (Years 5-30) |
| **Market Rate**     | Weak          | Maximum                 | High                | Weak                 | ✅ Partial (Year 30+)   |
| **TCAP Hybrid**     | **Strong**    | **Strong**              | **High**            | **Strong**           | ✅ **Yes**              |

## 2.8 Member Rights and Protections: Anti-Retaliation, Due Process, and Democratic Safeguards

### Anti-Retaliation Provisions (§ 26-1809 Implementation)

Member protection is fundamental to cooperative governance. Without explicit safeguards, members could face retaliation for exercising democratic rights (voting, speaking in meetings, reporting violations).

#### Statutory Framework (TCAP § 26-1809)

**Prohibited Retaliatory Actions:**

It shall be unlawful for any cooperative, board member, officer, or agent to retaliate against a member for:

1. **Exercising Democratic Rights:**

   - Voting in board elections
   - Attending member assemblies
   - Speaking during member discussions or board meetings
   - Proposing agenda items
   - Running for board position

1. **Reporting Violations:**

   - Reporting code violations to NYC Department of Buildings
   - Reporting housing law violations to HPD
   - Reporting Fair Housing Act violations to HUD
   - Reporting unsafe conditions to building inspector
   - Requesting accessibility accommodations (Fair Housing)

1. **Asserting Legal Rights:**

   - Requesting lease terms in writing
   - Requesting carrying charge calculation details
   - Contacting legal aid or tenant advocacy organization
   - Filing complaint with NYC Human Rights Commission
   - Requesting reasonable accommodation for disability

1. **Cooperative Participation:**

   - Organizing other members for democratic purposes
   - Forming member committee or caucus
   - Seeking legal counsel regarding cooperative decisions
   - Requesting independent audit of cooperative finances

**Retaliatory Actions (Prohibited):**

- Lease non-renewal or eviction
- Carrying charge increase (above formula-allowed increase)
- Reduction of services or amenities
- Discriminatory enforcement of rules
- Harassment or intimidation
- Exclusion from member communications
- Threats of eviction, lease non-renewal, or other adverse action

#### Rebuttable Presumption (Timing-Based)

**Key Protection (§ 26-1809(2)):** "An action by the cooperative against a member shall be presumed retaliatory if taken within ninety (90) days of the member's exercise of protected rights. The cooperative bears burden to prove non-retaliatory motivation."

**Practical Application:**

- Member attends board meeting and speaks against a major carrying charge increase (Day 1)
- Cooperative initiates eviction for alleged lease violation (Day 60)
- Presumption: Action is retaliatory (member exercised protected right within 90 days)
- Cooperative must prove: Lease violation existed before member's speech; eviction initiated before speech; or legitimate independent reason (burden on cooperative, not member)

**Rationale:** 90-day window reflects time lag typical for eviction procedures; creates protection window without being indefinite.

#### Private Right of Action (§ 26-1809(3))

Members have statutory right to sue for retaliation damages:

**Remedies Available:**

- Actual damages (costs incurred due to retaliation: legal fees, relocation, lost wages)
- Statutory damages: $1,000-$5,000 per violation (regardless of actual damages)
- Attorney's fees and court costs (prevailing plaintiff standard)
- Injunctive relief (court orders cessation of retaliatory conduct)
- Restoration of lease/membership status (if member unlawfully removed)

**Burden of Proof:** Preponderance of evidence (civil standard; not criminal beyond-reasonable-doubt)

**Forum:** NY civil court (or arbitration if cooperative bylaws require)

**Enforcement:** NYC Human Rights Commission can investigate; NY AG can enforce on behalf of multiple members

#### Practical Example: Anti-Retaliation Protection

**Scenario:**

- Member Juana organizes other members to challenge a $100/month carrying charge increase (proposed Year 5)
- Juana organizes 8 members; they attend member assembly and vote NO on increase
- Increase fails (members vote it down)
- Two months later, building inspector finds minor lease violation in Juana's unit (violation could apply to many units; not unique)
- Board initiates eviction for lease violation

**Legal Analysis:**

- Protected action: Juana's organizing and voting (Days 1-30)
- Alleged violation discovered: Day 65 (within 90-day presumption window)
- Eviction initiated: Day 70
- Presumption: Action presumed retaliatory (timing = within 90 days of protected action)
- Burden shifts to cooperative: Must prove violation existed before organizing; was independently motivated; or other legitimate reason
- If cooperative cannot prove legitimate reason: Retaliation presumed; Juana entitled to statutory damages ($1,000-$5,000) + attorney's fees + restoration of lease

**Member Protection Effectiveness:** This presumption structure enables ordinary members to exercise rights without fear of retaliation (burden on powerful cooperative, not vulnerable member).

### Due Process Requirements: Member Protections in Discipline

Members occupy housing they control. Removal from cooperative (eviction) represents loss of home and community. Statutory due process protects against arbitrary action.

#### Grounds for Lease Violation and Removal

**Valid Grounds for Eviction:**

- Non-payment of carrying charge (>60 days delinquent)
- Lease violation: Illegal activity in unit (drug manufacturing, weapons, etc.)
- Nuisance: Conduct substantially interfering with other members' quiet enjoyment (repeated noise violations, harassment, etc.)
- Unsafe conditions: Member creates hazard (hoarding, refuse, structural damage)
- Unauthorized occupants: Subletting or unauthorized residents in violation of lease
- Violation of community rules (e.g., pets prohibited if stated in lease)

**Invalid Grounds for Eviction (Prohibited):**

- Member's political or organizing activity
- Member's complaint to government authorities
- Member's race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, familial status, sexual orientation
- Member's housing code violation report
- Member's exercise of democratic rights

#### Due Process Procedure (§ 26-1809(4))

**Step 1: Written Notice (14 days before hearing)**

- Cooperative provides written notice of alleged violation
- Notice specifies: Date/time/nature of violation; lease section violated; specific evidence; requested remedy

**Step 2: Member Right to Respond (7 days)**

- Member can request in-person hearing; provide written response
- Member can present evidence contradicting cooperative's allegation
- Member can request legal counsel at hearing

**Step 3: Hearing Before Impartial Decision-Maker (14 days from notice)**

- Hearing conducted by: (a) Board subcommittee (not involved in allegation); or (b) Neutral arbitrator
- Member right to: Present evidence; question cooperative's witnesses; have counsel present
- Record kept: Hearing recorded or transcribed; member gets copy
- Decision issued: Written decision with findings of fact within 14 days of hearing

**Step 4: Decision and Remedy**

- If violation not proven: Charges dismissed; member continues occupancy
- If violation proven and minor: Lease violation notice (warning); cooperative works with member on remedy
- If violation proven and serious: Lease termination (eviction); 30-day notice before removal

**Step 5: Appeal (If Member Requests)**

- Member can appeal to member assembly (full membership votes)
- Assembly review: De novo review (not deferential to board; full reconsideration)
- Majority member vote required to sustain removal
- If assembly votes NO on removal: Member stays; charges dismissed

#### Key Safeguard: Presumption of Good Faith

**Cooperative Burden:** Cooperative must prove violation by preponderance of evidence (more likely than not). Member does not bear burden of proving innocence.

**Example:**

- Cooperative alleges member created nuisance (noise violation; complaints from 2 other members)
- Member claims noise was one-time event; denies pattern
- Burden on cooperative to document pattern; provide evidence of dates/times/witnesses
- If evidence insufficient (e.g., only 2 isolated complaints; no documentation): Member prevails

### Grievance and Conflict Resolution Procedures

Beyond formal due process for lease violations, cooperatives should have informal grievance mechanisms for other member concerns.

#### Informal Complaint Process

**Step 1: Direct Resolution (Days 1-14)**

- Member discusses concern directly with board member, officer, or committee chair
- Attempt informal resolution without formal procedure
- Many issues resolve at this stage (misunderstanding, missing information)

**Step 2: Grievance Committee Mediation (Days 15-30)**

- If direct resolution unsuccessful, member files written grievance with Grievance Committee
- Committee (typically 3-5 members; different from respondent) meets with both parties
- Mediator explains issues; seeks mutually acceptable resolution
- Success rate: 60-70% of grievances resolve in mediation

#### Formal Grievance Hearing

**If Mediation Unsuccessful (Day 30+):**

- Member can request formal grievance hearing before full Grievance Committee or Board
- Similar due process as lease violation hearing: notice, right to respond, hearing, decision
- Decision appealable to member assembly

**Grievance Committee Authority:**

- Can order cooperative to: Provide information; remedy condition; correct policy error
- Cannot: Overturn board decisions already made (unless arbitrary/capricious)
- Can recommend: Board reconsider decision; modify policy; provide explanation

### Fair Housing Act Application in Cooperatives

Cooperatives remain subject to Fair Housing Act (FHA) and NY Human Rights Law.

#### Protected Classes (7 Categories)

Cooperatives cannot discriminate in:

- Membership admission
- Lease terms or conditions
- Carrying charge or fee amounts
- Amenity or service access
- Board election participation
- Discipline or removal procedures

**Protected Classes:**

1. Race or color
1. Religion
1. National origin
1. Sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, sexual orientation)
1. Disability (physical or mental)
1. Familial status (families with children; pregnant individuals)
1. Sexual orientation (added under NYSHRL; many states still pending)

#### Reasonable Accommodations (Disability)

**Member Right:** Member with disability can request reasonable accommodation to enjoy equal access to housing.

**Examples of Accommodations:**

- Accessible parking near unit entrance
- Modification to bathroom for wheelchair access
- Service animal allowance (even if cooperative has no-pet policy)
- Accessible building entrance/elevator for mobility impairment
- Designated quiet floor for individual with hearing impairment
- TTY telephone system for deaf members

**Cooperative Obligation:** Cooperatives must provide reasonable accommodations unless creating undue financial/operational burden.

**Request Process:**

- Member makes written request explaining disability and needed accommodation
- Cooperative can request documentation from healthcare provider (but cannot refuse based on disability diagnosis)
- Cooperative has 10 days to approve or request clarification
- If denied, member can file complaint with HUD (180-day deadline) or NY Human Rights Commission (1-year deadline)

#### Discriminatory Harassment Prevention

**Cooperative Obligation:** Create environment free from harassment based on protected class.

**Examples of Harassment:**

- Board member uses racial slurs in meetings
- Member intimidates or threatens other member based on religion or national origin
- Enforcement of rules selectively (e.g., fining members of color for minor violations; ignoring white members for same violations)
- Exclusion from meetings or decision-making based on disability

**Member Remedy:**

- File complaint with NYC Human Rights Commission
- File lawsuit in civil court
- Request injunctive relief (cease harassment)
- Recover damages (actual + statutory + attorney's fees)

### Information Access Rights

Members have statutory right to cooperative financial and governance information.

#### Financial Information Access

**Member Right:** Member can inspect, copy, and obtain:

- Monthly operating statements (revenue, expenses, net)
- Annual budget
- Annual audit (prepared by independent CPA)
- Member's personal equity account statement
- Building assessment reports
- Tax forms (990, 1099-NEC for payments)

**Cooperative Obligation:** Provide within 10 business days; copy fees not to exceed $0.25/page

**Purpose:** Enables informed member participation (members can understand finances before voting on budget)

#### Governance Information Access

**Member Right:** Member can obtain:

- Meeting minutes (within 7 days of meeting)
- Board member contact information
- Bylaws and amendment history
- Lease/occupancy agreements
- House rules and policies
- Complaint procedures and forms

**Limitation:** Cooperative can withhold personnel information (board members' home addresses, phone numbers if requested for harassing purposes)

#### Member Equity Statement

**Cooperative Obligation (Annual):** Provide each member with written equity statement showing:

- Initial down payment
- Principal paydown accumulated
- Subsidy redirection accumulated
- Current equity balance
- Projected equity at next planned resale/exit

**Purpose:** Enables members to track wealth accumulation; plan for future

### Amendment Protections: Limits on Bylaw Changes

Members should be protected against cooperatives unilaterally amending bylaws to reduce member protections.

#### Protected Elements (Cannot Be Amended Away)

**Statutory Protections (§ 26-1804):**

- One-member-one-vote (cannot be amended to share-weighted voting)
- Democratic governance (cannot be amended to appointed board)
- Member majority on board (cannot reduce tenant representation)
- Annual member assemblies (cannot eliminate member meetings)
- Affordability covenant (cannot voluntarily eliminate 30-year restriction)

**These protections remain in effect regardless of bylaw amendment votes.**

#### Amendment Process

**For Amendable Bylaws:**

- Board proposes amendment (written; 30-day notice)
- Member assembly votes (supermajority 66%+ required)
- Amendment takes effect only if:
  - Required member vote achieved
  - Member impact assessment conducted (how change affects members)
  - HPD approval obtained (ensuring statute compliance)

**Member Protection:** Members know bylaws cannot be secretly changed; amendment requires transparent process and member vote.

### Exit Provisions: Protecting Member Right to Leave

Members should not be trapped in cooperative if circumstances change.

#### Resale Rights

**Member Right to Sell Share:**

- Member can sell share to next eligible buyer at formula price
- Cooperative has right of first refusal (can purchase instead of outside buyer)
- If cooperative exercises right of first refusal: Member receives formula price from cooperative
- If outside buyer purchases: Member receives formula price; next member enters cooperative

**Timeline:** 30-60 days from resale request to completion (standard real estate timeline)

#### Forced Exit Prevention

**Cooperative Cannot:**

- Force member to leave unless lease violation grounds met (with due process)
- Increase carrying charge beyond formula to discourage exit
- Reduce services to force exit
- Refuse to cooperate in resale process

**Member Protection:** Member control over timing of exit; cannot be involuntarily removed without due process.

#### Succession Planning (Family)

**Member Right:** If member dies, share passes to estate. Family member (spouse, adult child) can:

- Continue occupancy if income-eligible
- Assume parent's share at same terms (formula price; same carrying charge calculation)
- Inherit parent's accumulated equity

**Cooperative Obligation:** Work with family to facilitate succession (not create barriers)

## Key Takeaways from PART II-B

**Limited-Equity Cooperative Design:**

- Member-ownership via shares in cooperative (not individual units)
- Resale formula (restricts appreciation) maintains perpetual affordability
- Equity accumulation (principal paydown + subsidy redirection) builds member wealth
- Hybrid model (constant dollar Years 1-4; shared equity Years 5-30; market rate Year 30+) balances wealth and affordability

**Governance Framework:**

- One-member-one-vote principle prevents wealth concentration of voting power
- Tenant leader board majority (3-4 of 5-7) ensures member control
- Democratic elections with term limits prevent entrenchment
- Member assembly retains ultimate authority (budget, major decisions)
- Training and education ensure informed participation (30-hour curriculum)

**Resale Formulas and Wealth-Building:**

- Thistle case study: 22.1% IRR on shared equity formula; 94% affordability preservation
- TCAP hybrid formula: Constant dollar (Years 1-4) → Shared equity (Years 5-30) → Market rate (Year 30+)
- Member 10-year wealth projection: $79,000+ equity (from $8,000 initial)
- Member 30-year wealth projection: $180,000-220,000 equity (plus potential intergenerational transfer)

**Member Rights and Protections:**

- Anti-retaliation: 90-day presumption; member protected for exercising democratic rights
- Due process: Lease violations require hearing before impartial decision-maker; member appeal to full assembly
- Grievance procedures: Informal mediation + formal hearing process
- Fair Housing: Discrimination prohibited; reasonable accommodations required
- Information access: Members can inspect finances, governance documents, personal equity statements
- Amendment protections: Statutory safeguards cannot be amended away (one-vote-one vote; member majority; affordability covenant)

**Comparative Advantage:**

- vs. Market-rate Cooperatives: Limited equity preserves affordability; member control maintained
- vs. CLTs: Full member control; stronger wealth-building potential; 30-year permanent solution
- vs. Current Rental Subsidies: Member ownership; wealth accumulation; statutory permanence; democratic control
