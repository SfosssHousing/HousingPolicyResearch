---

## BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. Local Law Intro 902-A (Community Opportunity to Purchase Act) is hereby amended to add the following provisions:

# CHAPTER 20: TCAP-COPA INTEGRATION AND TENANT CONVERSION

## § 26-2001 Purpose

This chapter amends Intro 902 COPA provisions to provide extended timelines, preferential status, and procedural support for acquisitions leading to TCAP cooperative conversion, recognizing that tenant-controlled equity cooperatives represent a preferred anti-displacement and wealth-building outcome under COPA.

## § 26-2002 TCAP-Qualified Entity Status and Preferential Timeline

(a) **HPD Authority and Designation**: HPD shall designate TCAP-ready entities as a special category of Qualified Entity under Intro 902 COPA, including:

  (1) Nonprofit housing developers or CLTs sponsoring tenant associations or existing member organizations with plans to convert to TCAP cooperative ownership within 24–36 months of acquisition.

  (2) Community land trusts with demonstrated partnerships or commitments to TCAP conversion.

  (3) Member-controlled tenant associations that have formed legal capacity (incorporated as nonprofits or cooperative-formation entities) to acquire and hold real property.

(b) **TCAP-Qualified Entity Designation Requirements**: To qualify for TCAP-preferential status, an entity must:

  (1) Demonstrate prior experience acquiring, financing, and holding residential real property, or partner with experienced nonprofit/CLT partners.

  (2) Submit a binding Member Conversion Commitment (see § 26-2003) committing to cooperative conversion within specified timeframe.

  (3) Agree to maintain permanent affordability per Local Law A affordability covenant standards.

  (4) Commit to inclusive member recruitment and at least 40% Black and Latino membership composition.

(c) **Extended Timeline for TCAP-Qualified Entities**: A TCAP-qualified entity shall receive extended periods under Intro 902-A as follows:

  (1) **Statement of Interest Period**: 60 days (vs. standard 45 days in Intro 902-A) to submit statement of interest to owner and HPD.

  (2) **Exclusive Offer Period**: 120 days (vs. standard 90 days in Intro 902-A) to submit a competitive purchase offer.

  (3) **Financing Extension**: If the TCAP-qualified entity demonstrates that tenant organization and cooperative conversion will extend financing timeline beyond 120 days, HPD may grant an additional extension up to 60 days (180 days total), provided the entity submits monthly progress reports documenting member recruitment, certification, and financing progress.

  (4) **Right of First Refusal Duration**: 18 months (vs. 12 months in Intro 902-A) for the TCAP-qualified entity to exercise right of first refusal on any third-party offer received after rejection of initial offer.

(d) **Owner Incentives**: To facilitate TCAP acquisition, NYC may offer owner tax incentives, including property tax credits or reduced tax burden for sales to qualified nonprofits designated for tenant/TCAP conversion (consistent with state law authorizations under A355-C/S1718-B and similar).

## § 26-2003 Tenant Association Formation and TCAP Conversion Commitment

(a) **Tenant Association Requirement**: Before or in parallel with COPA purchase, tenants of the building must form or designate an existing tenant association to serve as the member-stakeholder body. HPD shall provide:

  (1) Organizational support and training at no cost to tenants.

  (2) Communications templates and meeting facilitation support.

  (3) Legal guidance on tenant association formation and governance.

(b) **Member Conversion Commitment**: The purchasing entity (nonprofit, CLT, or tenant-led entity) must execute a binding Member Conversion Commitment with the tenant association, filed with HPD, committing to:

  (1) **Timeline**: Convert the property to a TCAP cooperative (per Local Law A) within 24–36 months of closing, with monthly progress reporting to HPD.

  (2) **Member Certification**: Complete member income verification and governance training for at least 75% of current tenants within 12 months of closing.

  (3) **Member Equity**: Establish individual member equity accounts (per Local Law A § 26-1805) for all members within 3 months of cooperative formation.

  (4) **Occupancy Protection**: Maintain occupancy of existing rent-stabilized or subsidized tenants for a minimum of 10 years post-conversion, subject to member affordability and equity criteria under TCAP.

  (5) **Democratic Control**: Achieve member democratic control (board majority of residents, member assembly voting rights, annual elections) by end of Year 3.

  (6) **Affordability Covenant**: Record TCAP affordability covenant (Local Law A § 26-1807) on title within 30 days of cooperative formation.

(c) **Noncompliance Consequences**: If the purchasing entity fails to achieve cooperative conversion within the commitment timeline or breaches material terms:

  (1) HPD shall issue a compliance notice and provide 60-day cure opportunity.

  (2) If cure is not achieved, HPD may appoint a successor entity to complete conversion or facilitate member buyout.

  (3) If tenant association votes to terminate the relationship and seek alternative nonprofit stewardship, they retain right to do so.

(d) **HPD Oversight**: HPD shall designate a TCAP Conversion Monitor to:

  (1) Receive monthly progress reports from the purchasing entity.

  (2) Conduct site visits and member interviews to verify conversion progress.

  (3) Facilitate dispute resolution if tenant association and purchasing entity disagree on conversion procedures.

  (4) Recommend enforcement action if conversion timeline is not met.

## § 26-2004 Subsidy Continuity and DSS Coordination

(a) **DSS Subsidy Assurance Letter**: When a TCAP-qualified entity submits a COPA statement of interest, HPD shall request that DSS issue a letter of intent committing to:

  (1) Honor existing CityFHEPS vouchers held by current tenants post-closing, without interruption.

  (2) Transfer subsidy payments to the cooperative's account (vs. individual tenants) once the cooperative is established.

  (3) Implement subsidy-to-equity conversion (80% carrying charge / 20% equity account) per Local Law A upon cooperative formation.

(b) **Maintenance of Existing Vouchers**: Current tenants holding CityFHEPS or equivalent subsidies shall retain their vouchers and subsidy levels (indexed annually) post-closing. Subsidy shall continue to flow during the entire conversion period, preventing income gaps or subsidy loss.

(c) **New Member Subsidy Access**: Existing tenants not currently subsidized may apply for housing subsidy (CityFHEPS or emergency assistance) after TCAP cooperative formation. DSS shall:

  (1) Prioritize such applications for households below 50% AMI.

  (2) Streamline application and income verification using information already compiled during member certification.

(d) **Subsidy Adequacy**: HPD and DSS shall jointly monitor whether the subsidy level is adequate to maintain the 15% member affordability cap; if not, subsidy shall be increased per Local Law A § 26-1803(b).

## § 26-2005 Member Racial Equity Targeting

(a) **Requirement**: TCAP-qualified entities shall commit in their Member Conversion Commitment to achieve and maintain:

  (1) At least 40% Black and Latino membership composition at lease-up and annually thereafter.

  (2) At least 50% of initial member equity distributions directed to Black and Latino households.

  (3) Board composition reflecting member demographic diversity.

(b) **Recruitment**: TCAP-qualified entities shall conduct targeted outreach to ensure diverse applicant pools, including partnerships with community organizations serving communities of color.

(c) **Monitoring**: HPD shall monitor racial equity outcomes annually and report to the City Council per Local Law D § 26-2104.

## § 26-2006 Implementation and Effective Date

This chapter shall become effective upon enactment and shall apply to all COPA acquisitions with TCAP conversion commitments entered into after the effective date.
