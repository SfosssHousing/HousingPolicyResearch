# Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework for NYC Housing  
## Master Policy Report – v2025-12-17

---

## Executive Summary

New York City faces an unprecedented housing affordability crisis while holding billions in annual rental-subsidy expenditures that produce no resident wealth or housing stability. The **Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework** restructures existing city rental subsidies—currently distributed via CityFHEPS, FHEPS, and Section 8 vouchers—into **resident equity investments** held within cooperatives, community land trusts (CLTs), and resident-controlled entities.

By redirecting a portion of annual subsidy payments (e.g., 20–30% of HRA's CityFHEPS outlay) from landlord rent payments into resident equity accounts, PET converts temporary rental assistance into permanent ownership stakes, enabling low-income households to build housing wealth while stabilizing neighborhoods and reducing city eviction/shelter costs.

**Fiscal impact:** Redirected subsidies fund equity accrual without new net appropriation; breakeven on city budget within 7–10 years via avoided shelter/eviction costs. Potential cumulative savings: $50–100M over decade if scaled to 5,000 households.

**Equity impact:** Median household equity accrual $500–1,000/year, cumulative $25,000–50,000 over 10-year vesting period. Eviction rate reduction 50–70% (vs. status quo subsidy) by enabling household asset base and cooperative collective action. Permanent wealth retention across generations (Article XI low-income restrictions ensure successor inheritance at controlled prices).

**Legal feasibility:** Framework is operationally sound under existing NY PHFL Article XI, provided PET mechanisms avoid ANCP-style pass-through entities and cap federal subsidy reliance at ≤50% of resident debt service. Requires administrative reinterpretation of HRA/HPD authorities and possible limited NYC Code amendments.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Housing Crisis & Subsidy Inefficiency

NYC spends approximately **$4–5 billion annually** on rental assistance programs (CityFHEPS, FHEPS, Section 8, emergency vouchers) serving ~300,000 low-income renter households. These subsidies are **temporary and non-wealth-building**: they prevent immediate eviction but leave households with zero accumulated assets, zero home equity, and zero housing security beyond current lease term.

**Outcomes of current subsidy model:**
- Eviction rate: ~95,000 eviction filings annually; ~30,000 non-payment evictions (pre-COVID numbers; post-COVID elevated).
- Shelter utilization: ~64,000 persons (families + individuals) in NYC shelter system as of 2024; annual shelter cost >$3 billion.
- Homelessness: Record-high youth homelessness (154,000 NYC school students experienced homelessness in 2023–24 school year).
- Wealth gap: Low-income renters accrue zero home equity; median net worth of renter households <$10,000 (vs. median homeowner net worth >$250,000).

### 1.2 Failed Legacy Models: TIL & ANCP

NYC has experimented with resident-ownership models for 40+ years:

**Tenant Interim Lease (TIL, 1978–present):**
- Promised low-income tenants of abandoned in rem buildings: $250 cooperative ownership purchase after 11 months of successful management.
- Delivered mixed results: ~90 HDFC co-ops created (success); ~190 buildings languished in "interim" status for 20–40 years (failure).
- Root causes per 2017 Broken Promise audit: HPD mismanagement, warehousing of vacant units, under-training of tenant boards, withdrawal of capital support, lack of clear timelines or exit strategy.

**Affordable Neighborhood Cooperative Program (ANCP, 2012–present):**
- Designed to address TIL backlog by mixing low-income TIL tenants with moderate-income cooperators (100–120% AMI) in rehabilitated buildings.
- Outcomes: TIL residents become minority owners in mixed-income coops; high reliance on volatile Section 8 subsidies for affordability; $2,500+ buy-in costs (vs. $250 TIL promise); 30-year tax abatement with uncertain post-abatement affordability.
- New risk: If federal subsidies cut, maintenance charges become unaffordable; high foreclosure risk for low-income members.

**Lessons learned:**
- Resident ownership works **if properly supported** (training, clear timelines, ongoing management support, capital reinvestment).
- Reliance on federal subsidies for >50% of debt service creates fragility to policy cuts.
- Mixed-income coops can marginalize low-income members (governance, special assessments, affordability pressure).
- HPD's track record as direct manager is weak; better to redirect subsidy to **credit unions + resident boards** than city-managed programs.

### 1.3 Current DSS/HPD Program Landscape

**HRA (Human Resources Administration) operates:**
- **CityFHEPS:** City rental-assistance voucher (~$950/month average in 2024, covers 70–85% of rent for eligible households); serves ~50,000 families and individuals.
- **FHEPS:** State rent supplement for families with children receiving Cash Assistance; ~$1,100/month average; serves ~15,000 families.
- **Emergency rental assistance:** Short-term grants for back-rent, security deposits, moving costs via Homebase program (25 locations).

**HPD (Housing Preservation & Development) manages:**
- **NYCHA public housing:** 178,000 apartments; ~$4B capital backlog; rent averaging $600–900/month for very-low-income residents.
- **In rem / Tenant Interim Lease portfolio:** ~100–120 buildings (exact count uncertain) with mixed ownership status (city, HDFC, private).
- **ANCP:** ~10–15 buildings in active conversion pipeline.

**Key integration opportunity:** HRA's intake machinery (Homebase, case management, income verification) can be re-purposed to identify PET-eligible households and feed them into cooperative/CLT equity pipelines.

## 2. Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework: Core Design

### 2.1 Core Concept

**PET converts monthly rental-subsidy payments into resident equity accrual:**

| Cash Flow Element | Status Quo (CityFHEPS) | PET Model |
|---|---|---|
| **City payment to landlord** | $950/month (100% of city outlay) | $665/month (70% of city outlay) |
| **Tenant cash payment** | $400–500/month (tenant responsibility) | $400–500/month (tenant responsibility, unchanged) |
| **New: Equity accrual** | $0 | $285/month (30% of city outlay) → resident equity account |
| **Total rent paid** | $1,350–1,450 | $1,350–1,450 (unchanged) |
| **City annual commitment** | $11,400 per household | $7,980 rent payment + $3,420 equity = $11,400 (same) |
| **Household wealth after 10 years** | $0 (renter, no equity) | ~$34,200 accumulated (investor-owner) |

**Key principle:** No new city spending. PET **redirects** existing subsidy allocations from landlord payments into resident equity pools. Household rent burden and city budget remain constant; only ownership and wealth accumulation change.

### 2.2 PET Governance Model

**Resident-controlled entities (three options; policy to select):**

1. **Limited-equity cooperative (HDFC under Article XI):**
   - Residents are member-owners of cooperative corporation.
   - Equity shares represent ownership stake + vote on building governance.
   - Shares are restricted to low-income buyers (≤100–120% AMI) in perpetuity per Article XI.
   - Each member has one vote (one person, one vote) regardless of share value.
   - Maintenance charges include debt service, operations, reserves (similar to condo HOA).

2. **Community Land Trust (CLT) with resident leaseholders:**
   - CLT (nonprofit) holds land in perpetuity; residents lease land long-term (99-year renewable lease).
   - Residents own building improvements; CLT ground lease includes permanent affordability covenant.
   - Residents elect CLT board (majority must be site-based residents).
   - Ground-lease payment typically lower than full ownership (reduces debt service burden).

3. **Hybrid (CLT land + cooperative building):**
   - CLT holds land; residents form cooperative to own building collectively.
   - Combines benefits: affordable land (CLT), collective governance (coop), resident control.

**PET role in governance:**
- Residents' accumulated equity is held in **Individual Equity Accounts** (managed by HPD or delegated credit union).
- At vesting milestone (e.g., year 5–10), household can use equity as down payment to purchase full cooperative share or formalize CLT residency.
- Equity accrual rate is transparent, disclosed monthly, and projected to household.

### 2.3 PET Budget & Funding Model

**No-new-net-cost principle:**

| Funding Source | Annual Amount | Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| HRA CityFHEPS annual appropriation (status quo) | $600M (estimated) | $420M → landlord payments (70%); $180M → PET equity pools (30%) |
| HPD ANCP / TIL capital (redirected) | $50M | $35M → building rehab capital; $15M → PET equity admin + reserve fund |
| Credit union loan origination (member deposits, not subsidy) | $100M (estimated) | Member-coop equity financing (residents can borrow against equity to buy full share) |
| **Total city incremental cost** | **$0** | **Budget-neutral; subsidy is redirected, not added** |

**Reserve & contingency:**
- Establish **PET Emergency Reserve Fund** (seed $10–20M from HPD operational savings or Section 8 realignment).
- Reserve covers federal subsidy cuts, member default losses, building capital emergencies.
- Replenished from excess equity-pool income (if any) or annual city allocation.

### 2.4 Household Eligibility & Income Banding

**Income criteria (per HUD 2024 AMI, NYC Metro FMR):**

| Family Size | 100% AMI (Eligible Range) | 150% AMI (Upper Limit) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 person | $108,750 | $163,100 |
| 2 person | $124,250 | $186,400 |
| 3 person | $139,800 | $209,700 |
| 4 person | $155,300 | $232,950 |

**PET enrollment policy:**
- **Primary target:** Households ≤100% AMI (same as CityFHEPS eligibility).
- **Secondary cohort (optional):** Households 100–150% AMI (if building includes moderate-income cooperators under ANCP-style mixed-income).
- **Exclusions:** Households >150% AMI; active eviction judgments (within 1 year); chronic rent delinquency (>2 months in past 24 months without remediation plan).

---

## 3. Implementation Architecture

### 3.1 Three Pilot Scenarios

**Pilot 1 (Year 1):** Distressed TIL/HDFC conversion
- Target: 1–2 buildings with existing organized tenant associations (e.g., 161 West 108th Street, Manhattan; or equivalent in other boroughs).
- Scope: 40–80 households; ~$1.5–2.5M redirected subsidy annually.
- Outcome: Demonstrate full PET workflow (intake, underwriting, equity-share agreement, payment routing, governance, default handling).
- Timeline: Intake Q2 2026; enrollment Q3 2026; live equity accrual Q4 2026.

**Pilot 2 (Year 2, contingent on Pilot 1 success):** ANCP replacement
- Target: Buildings currently in ANCP pipeline; replace mixed-income structure with pure-PET low-income cooperative.
- Scope: 3–5 buildings; ~200–300 households; ~$5–7.5M redirected subsidy annually.
- Outcome: Demonstrate scalability; compare PET to ANCP on affordability, member satisfaction, foreclosure risk.

**Pilot 3 (Year 2–3, contingent on Pilots 1–2):** DSS/Homebase pipeline
- Target: Households currently on CityFHEPS vouchers; identify buildings for preservation or conversion to PET-enabled cooperatives.
- Scope: Smaller, dispersed buildings (10–20 units each); ~100 households per year; ~$2–3M redirected subsidy annually.
- Outcome: Test DSS/Homebase intake integration; assess household demand for equity vs. traditional vouchers.

### 3.2 Operational Integration Points

**DSS/Homebase intake → PET enrollment:**
1. Homebase caseworker identifies household at risk of eviction or seeking stable housing.
2. During intake assessment (current crisis resolution), caseworker screens for PET eligibility: income, credit history, interest in cooperative ownership.
3. If eligible and interested: household is referred to HPD PET enrollment team (separate workflow from emergency rental assistance).
4. HPD PET team conducts full underwriting (income verification, credit check, building assignment).
5. Upon approval: household signs PET equity-share agreement (with Right-to-Counsel review) and is matched to cooperative/CLT building.

**HRA CityFHEPS payment routing → equity accrual:**
1. HRA system receives notice of PET enrollment for household X at Building Y.
2. HRA updates household payment configuration: split CityFHEPS payment 70/30 (70% to building landlord/coop; 30% to HPD equity account).
3. Monthly HRA payment: $665 to coop bank account; $285 to household's individual equity sub-account (HPD or credit-union-managed).
4. Household receives monthly statement showing rent paid (city + personal), equity accrued, and projected 5-year / 10-year balance.

**Cooperative governance → equity transparency:**
1. Cooperative board (resident-controlled) meets quarterly with HPD PET coordinator to review equity-pool status, discuss member questions, resolve disputes.
2. Board includes elected PET representative who advocates for member-owners' equity rights.
3. Building financial statements include aggregate equity-pool balance and per-member average accrual.

**Credit union financing (optional):**
1. Participating credit union (e.g., Lower East Side People's FCU) becomes secondary lender for PET members.
2. Members can borrow against accumulated equity to finance: initial cooperative share purchase, down payment buyout, or building capital improvements (with board approval).
3. Credit union underwriting uses PET member track record (payment history, equity balance) as primary credit indicator (reduces reliance on credit score).

### 3.3 Legal & Governance Safeguards

**Article XI compliance (perpetual low-income housing):**
- All PET-enabled cooperatives or CLTs are subject to NY PHFL Article XI or equivalent deed restrictions.
- Resident shares cannot be sold above 100–120% AMI income-adjusted pricing, ensuring affordability across generations.
- Residents cannot exit the low-income ownership structure (except by selling share within qualified pool or inheriting at controlled price).

**Federal subsidy sustainability:**
- PET is designed to limit reliance on federal subsidies to ≤50% of resident maintenance obligations.
- If Section 8 or CityFHEPS appropriations are cut, city redirects additional equity-pool reserves (from Emergency Reserve Fund) to maintain affordability; residents are not abandoned mid-ownership.
- Annual stress-testing of federal-subsidy-cut scenarios included in ROI model.

**Racial equity & fair housing:**
- Pilot building selection uses stratified random sampling to avoid concentrating PET in low-Black/Latino neighborhoods (vs. high-opportunity areas).
- Mandatory racial equity impact statement before major rollouts (precedent: NYC rezoning equity assessments).
- Annual reporting disaggregated by race, ethnicity, family size, borough, and income band to monitor for disparate impact.
- Right-to-Counsel coverage extends to all PET households (intake through exit) to prevent discrimination.

**Default & exit rules:**
- Household rent delinquency >30 days triggers cooperative notice + Right-to-Counsel intervention (prevent hasty eviction).
- If household defaults and is evicted, accumulated equity is forfeited to cooperative (harsh but incentivizes payment); household is offered payment plan, hardship review, or exit with partial equity buyout (policy option).
- If household voluntarily exits (moves), equity balance is liquidated: household receives cash payout (if eligible for non-PET housing), or equity is transferred to incoming household (if staying in PET ecosystem), or retained in cooperative emergency reserve.

## 4. Fiscal Analysis & ROI Modeling

### 4.1 Base-Case Scenario (10-Year Horizon)

**Pilot 1 assumptions:**
- Building: 60 households; average income $50,000 (55% AMI).
- Monthly rent/maintenance charge: $1,200 (mid-range for NYC).
- HRA CityFHEPS subsidy: $840/month (70% of rent).
- PET equity accrual: $240/month (30% of city outlay, or $2,880/year per household).
- Assumed eviction rate (status quo subsidy): 8% annually (~5 households/year).
- Assumed eviction rate (with PET): 2% annually (~1 household/year).

**City cash-flow analysis (10-year cumulative):**

| Category | Status Quo (Pure Subsidy) | PET Model | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HRA CityFHEPS outlay (rent payments)** | $6,048,000 | $4,233,600 | -$1,814,400 (30% redirected to equity) |
| **HPD/HRA case management + Right-to-Counsel** | $300,000 | $600,000 | +$300,000 (PET-specific legal services) |
| **PET equity pool admin (credit union, accounting)** | $0 | $200,000 | +$200,000 (equity management overhead) |
| **Shelter diversion (avoided shelter cost per eviction)** | $600,000 (5 evictions × $120k/year × avg 1 year) | $100,000 (1 eviction × $120k × avg 0.8 year) | -$500,000 (PET reduces eviction 80%) |
| **Building capital (city rehab support)** | $500,000 | $500,000 | $0 (same) |
| **TOTAL CITY COST** | **$7,448,000** | **$5,633,600** | **-$1,814,400 (24% savings)** |
| | | | |
| **Household wealth (cumulative equity accrual)** | $0 | $1,728,000 (60 HH × $28,800 each) | +$1,728,000 (100% gain) |
| **NPV of savings (7% discount rate)** | — | — | **+$1,100,000 city net savings over decade** |

**Interpretation:**
- By redirecting 30% of CityFHEPS to equity, city breaks even on budget within ~7 years (via avoided shelter/eviction costs).
- Decade-long net savings: $1.1M for 60 households (Pilot 1).
- Scaled to 5,000 households: $90M+ net savings over decade.
- Household wealth creation: 60 households accrue $28,800 each in equity (median $2,400/year); can be passed to heirs at controlled prices (perpetual affordability).

### 4.2 Sensitivity & Risk Scenarios

**Scenario A: 20% federal subsidy cut (e.g., Section 8 appropriation reduced 2028)**
- Impact: PET residents would need to cover higher percentage of maintenance (target 30% → 40% tenant share).
- Mitigation: Emergency Reserve Fund covers 50% of gap ($100/month × 60 residents × 12 months = $72,000/year); residents absorb remainder via special assessment or equity-accrual pause.
- Result: Affordable housing maintained; no foreclosure spiral (because residents have equity cushion + collective action via coop board).

**Scenario B: Cooperative building default (DSCR drops below 1.0)**
- Trigger: Major capital emergency (roof collapse, foundation repair) not budgeted; building cannot service debt + maintenance.
- Mitigation: HPD emergency capital (from PET Emergency Reserve Fund or HPD capital realignment); residents may undertake special assessment or equity-accrual pause; building restructuring (refinance, property tax challenge).
- Result: Building stabilized; residents retain ownership (vs. foreclosure under landlord / mixed-income coop model where bank forecloses and evicts low-income members).

**Scenario C: Household income rise (member earnings increase above PET eligibility)**
- Policy option 1: Household exits PET, pays market rent at cooperative, retains accumulated equity (converted to full share purchase or cash buyout).
- Policy option 2: Household remains in PET coop but assumes higher rent share (progressive affordability).
- Result: No forced displacement; equity wealth retained; building replaces exiting household with new low-income PET member.

## 5. Equity Impact & Distributional Analysis

### 5.1 Wealth Accumulation

**Baseline comparison:**

| Metric | Renter on CityFHEPS (Status Quo) | PET Member-Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **10-year equity accrual** | $0 | $28,800–43,200 (depending on accrual rate) |
| **Inheritance to next generation** | $0 (lease ends) | Cooperative share at Article XI controlled price (~$50–150k, depending on building improvements); heritable to spouse/children if income-eligible |
| **Housing security** | Temporary (voucher subject to annual recertification, federal cuts) | Permanent (cooperative ownership, low-income deed restriction in perpetuity) |
| **Collective action power** | Minimal (individual tenant vs. landlord) | High (resident-controlled cooperative board; member votes on rent, repairs, assessments) |

**Disaggregated equity outcomes (by race/ethnicity, family size, income band):**

Assumption: PET pilot recruited from DSS/Homebase caseload (~70% Black, 20% Latino, 5% Asian, 5% other; 60% single-parent households, 30% couples, 10% seniors).

| Demographic | # Households (Pilot 1) | Avg. Annual Income | Avg. Annual Equity Accrual | 10-Year Cumulative Equity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Black single mothers** | 21 | $38,000 | $2,400 | $28,800 |
| **Latino mixed families** | 12 | $50,000 | $2,880 | $34,560 |
| **Asian / other** | 3 | $52,000 | $2,880 | $34,560 |
| **Seniors (55+)** | 6 | $32,000 | $2,160 | $25,920 |
| **Total (all cohorts)** | 42 | ~$45,000 median | ~$2,480 median | ~$29,760 median |

**Wealth-gap implications:**
- Current median net worth for low-income NYC renters: <$10,000 (largely debt, no assets).
- PET member median net worth after 10 years: ~$40,000–50,000 (equity share value + any additional savings).
- Intergenerational wealth: If member passes cooperative share to child, child inherits asset with ~$50–100k market value (locked at low-income price but heritable); can be used for college, small business, or sold back into PET ecosystem.

### 5.2 Eviction & Housing Stability Impact

**Eviction rate reduction:**

| Status | Status Quo Subsidy (CityFHEPS only) | PET Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Annual eviction rate (baseline)** | 8% | 2% |
| **Reason for reduction** | Temporary subsidy; no skin in the game; landlord can evict and re-let at market rate | Member-owner has equity stake; cooperative board mediates disputes; eviction = member loses accumulated wealth (collective action) |
| **Right-to-Counsel integration** | Available; depends on funding; may be insufficient for all cases | Mandated; budget-protected at 2–3% of PET spending; every member has free legal review of equity agreements + default scenarios |

**Shelter diversion savings:**
- One eviction = estimated $120,000–200,000 city cost (shelter, DHS case management, legal services, rehousing).
- PET reduces evictions from 5/year to 1/year in 60-unit pilot = $480,000–800,000 annual savings.
- Scaled to 5,000 households: ~$40–50M annual savings via eviction prevention alone.

### 5.3 Neighborhood Stabilization

**Secondary benefits:**
- Resident ownership increases building maintenance (members have incentive to preserve asset).
- Cooperative boards engage in community organizing (collective power; advocacy for school resources, transit, safety).
- Intergenerational residents (families not displaced every 2–3 years) create neighborhood social cohesion.
- Lower turnover reduces housing instability, allows children to stay in schools, strengthens community networks.

---

## 6. Legal Framework & Governance

### 6.1 Statutory Basis & Required Changes

**Existing authorities (leverage):**
- NY PHFL Article XI: Enables HDFC cooperatives with perpetual low-income restrictions. **No statutory change needed** for PET to use this framework.
- NYC Admin Code § 11–112: HPD authority to manage, dispose of, or leverage in rem property. **Interpretation adjustment needed** to permit equity-investment redirection (not currently explicit).
- HRA CityFHEPS statute (NYC Admin Code § 21–403): Establishes rental assistance. **Reinterpretation needed** to permit CityFHEPS payment split into equity accrual (vs. pure rent subsidy).

**Proposed changes (minimal, non-controversial):**
1. **NYC Admin Code § 11–112.1 (NEW):** "HPD may redirect rental-subsidy funds into resident equity pools within cooperative or CLT entities, provided that such pools are held in trust for resident benefit and managed according to resident-approved governance bylaws."
2. **HRA guidance memo on CityFHEPS (interpretation):** Clarify that a portion of CityFHEPS appropriation can be directed to resident equity accounts (not paid to landlord) without losing subsidy classification.
3. **NYDFS guidance letter (requested):** Confirm that credit-union member-cooperative lending for PET is permissible under NY Banking Law § 130 (community development mission).

### 6.2 Article XI Perpetuity & Affordability Controls

**How Article XI protects PET:**
- Any cooperative holding PET resident shares must be HDFC incorporated under PHFL Article XI.
- Article XI mandates low-income purpose (housing project for persons of low income).
- Share resale prices are capped at affordable levels (typically 100–120% AMI income-adjusted); resales outside that band are prohibited.
- **Perpetuity:** Restrictions are permanent (no sunset); pass through generations.

**PET-specific guardrails:**
- No pass-through entities (ANCP's "Restoring Communities HDFC" model avoided): direct transfer of property to resident-controlled HDFC.
- Equity accrual does not exempt share from Article XI pricing limits; wealthy heirs cannot buy at market rate.
- Succession rights for family members (spouse, children, parents) are explicit in PET bylaws; 30-day filing windows are replaced with longer grace periods (respect cultural burial / mourning practices).

## 7. Risk Management & Mitigation

### 7.1 Principal Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Federal subsidy cut (Section 8 / CityFHEPS)** | HIGH | Cap reliance ≤50% of debt; Emergency Reserve Fund; stress-test annually |
| **Budget constraint (no-new-net-cost violated)** | MEDIUM | Zero-based reallocation; pilot at small scale; OMB oversight; monthly reconciliation |
| **Building governance failure (tenant boards lack capacity)** | MEDIUM | 8–12 week pre-conversion training; HPD coordinator on-site; Right-to-Counsel support |
| **Article XI perpetuity creates wealth ceiling** | MEDIUM | Transparent disclosure; controlled-appreciation framing; successor buyout pathways |
| **Racial equity disparate impact** | MEDIUM | Mandatory equity impact statement; stratified random pilot selection; disaggregated reporting |
| **Credit union partner withdrawal** | LOW | Diversify lender pool; backup model (city as direct lender or CLT intermediary) |
| **Mayoral turnover or agency leadership change** | MEDIUM | Anchor in statute (NYC Code amendment); stakeholder coalition (tenant orgs, legal services, credit unions) |

### 7.2 Contingency Plans

**If federal subsidy is cut 20%:**
- PET Emergency Reserve Fund covers 50% gap; residents cover remainder via special assessment or equity-accrual pause.
- City advances additional $5–10M capital if needed to avoid foreclosure; recovers via future equity realizations.

**If pilot 1 building defaults:**
- HPD takes temporary management control; restructures debt with lenders; stabilizes building.
- Residents remain as member-owners (not displaced); participation in restructuring process via cooperative board.

**If NYDFS denies credit-union loan guidance:**
- Backup: HPD creates direct-lending authority (city issues equity-backed loans to resident-cooperatives); or CLT becomes intermediary lender.

## 9. Conclusion & Recommendations

### 9.1 Why PET Is Feasible & Necessary

NYC's rental-subsidy system is dysfunctional: it costs $4–5B annually but produces zero household wealth, perpetuates eviction cycles, and leaves low-income renters trapped in precarity. ANCP and TIL, while well-intentioned, failed because they lacked clear timelines, relied on volatile federal subsidies, and gave residents insufficient control.

**PET addresses these failures by:**
1. **Redirecting existing subsidy** into resident equity (no new spending).
2. **Leveraging resident control** (cooperatives, CLTs) to ensure sustainable governance.
3. **Capping federal subsidy reliance** at ≤50% of debt (resilience to cuts).
4. **Prioritizing permanent affordability** via Article XI low-income deed restrictions.
5. **Integrating civil-rights protections** (racial equity, ADA/504, Right-to-Counsel).

### 9.2 Decision Asks

**For HPD Commissioner & HRA Administrator:**
- Approve Phase II research and drafting (3–4 months).
- Designate HPD PET Coordinator and HRA liaison officer (by Phase II Week 4).
