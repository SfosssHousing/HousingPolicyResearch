**A LOCAL LAW**

To amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing the public equity transfer framework for housing subsidy conversion to cooperative ownership

**Be it enacted by the Council as follows:**

**Subsidized limited-equity cooperative.** The term "subsidized limited-equity cooperative" means a limited-equity cooperative in which tenant-owners utilize convertible public housing equity instruments toward share acquisition, cooperative reserve contributions, and ongoing carrying charges as authorized under this chapter.

## LEGISLATIVE MEMORANDUM

**TO:** New York City Council, Committee on Housing and Buildings  
**FROM:** [Bill Sponsors]  
**DATE:** October 2025  
**RE:** Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) Legislative Package

### I. PURPOSE AND SUMMARY

This legislative package establishes a comprehensive framework for converting rental housing subsidies into equity-building cooperative ownership opportunities for low-income New York City residents. The package consists of four interrelated local laws that:

1. Create a Public Equity Transfer Framework (PETF) authorizing subsidy-to-equity conversion
2. Establish a Subsidized Limited-Equity Cooperative classification
3. Expand tenant opportunity to purchase rights
4. Implement the Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) with oversight structures

### II. BACKGROUND

New York City allocates over $5 billion annually in rental subsidies, yet these funds do not generate wealth or ownership opportunities for recipients. Meanwhile, the racial homeownership gap persists: only 27% of Black and 17% of Latino households own homes, compared to 44% of white households.

This package responds to this inequity by reimagining subsidies as tools for collective ownership and wealth building, rather than perpetual rent payments to private landlords.

### III. KEY PROVISIONS

**Public Equity Transfer Framework (Local Law A):**
- Authorizes HPD to redirect subsidies to cooperative equity
- Establishes eligibility criteria for properties and tenants
- Creates phased subsidy allocation structure
- Establishes Tenant Opportunity Fund
- Mandates affordability covenants (30-year minimum)

**Subsidized Limited-Equity Cooperative Classification (Local Law B):**
- Creates new regulatory category
- Provides tax incentives for compliance
- Exempts tenant-initiated conversions from certain requirements
- Establishes oversight mechanisms

**Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Rights (Local Law C):**
- Requires 90-day notice before property sales
- Grants tenants right of first opportunity
- Provides matching rights against third-party offers
- Extends protections to foreclosure and tax lien sales

**TCAP Implementation (Local Law D):**
- Establishes TCAP Task Force with diverse stakeholder representation
- Mandates pilot program with 5 sites
- Creates Tenant Opportunity Fund infrastructure
- Requires data transparency and annual reporting

### IV. LEGAL AUTHORITY

The City Council has broad home rule authority under the New York State Constitution and Municipal Home Rule Law to enact legislation promoting public health, safety, and welfare. This package is consistent with:

- NYC Charter provisions governing HPD and housing policy
- Federal HUD regulations (subject to waiver requests)
- NYS Real Property Law and Cooperative Corporations Law
- NYC Administrative Code affordable housing provisions

### V. STAKEHOLDER SUPPORT

This legislation is supported by:
- Housing Justice for All coalition
- Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB)
- Right to Counsel NYC Coalition
- Community Voices Heard
- Picture the Homeless
- Metropolitan Council on Housing
- Community Service Society
- [Additional organizations]

### VI. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

- **Day 1-180:** Rulemaking, interagency agreements, stakeholder engagement
- **Month 6-12:** Pilot site selection and tenant outreach
- **Year 1-3:** Pilot implementation with evaluation
- **Year 3-5:** Program refinement and scaling plan
- **Year 5+:** Citywide expansion

### VII. ADDRESSING CONCERNS

**"Will this reduce available subsidies?"**  
No. The legislation explicitly requires maintaining the full value of subsidies. Funds are redirected to equity-building, not reduced.

**"Can HPD administer this program?"**  
Yes. HPD has extensive experience with cooperative housing through HDFC program, Third Party Transfer program, and other initiatives. Additional staffing is budgeted.

**"What about tenants who don't want to participate?"**  
Participation is voluntary. Non-participating tenants retain rental status with continued subsidy support. No tenant will be displaced.

**"Is this financially sustainable?"**  
Yes. The program generates long-term savings through reduced shelter costs, eviction prevention, and administrative efficiency. It becomes cost-neutral within 7 years.

### VIII. CONCLUSION

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program represents a bold but fiscally responsible reimagining of housing policy. By converting subsidies into ownership pathways, we can address racial wealth gaps, promote housing stability, and empower tenants as stewards of their communities.

We urge the Council to pass this legislation and make New York City a national leader in equitable housing policy.
