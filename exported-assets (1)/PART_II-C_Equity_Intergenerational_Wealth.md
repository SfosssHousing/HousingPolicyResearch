## 2.9 Subsidy-to-Equity Conversion Mechanics: How Subsidies Build Member Wealth

### The Problem with Current Subsidy Models (Consumption vs. Investment)

Current NYC housing subsidies—Section 8, CityFHEPS, CASH—operate as consumption subsidies. Members receive monthly assistance to pay rent; landlords receive payment; members accumulate zero equity.

**Current Subsidy Model Flow:**

- DSS allocates: $1,800/month to member
- Member pays: $1,650/month rent to landlord (DSS subsidy covers $1,200; member contributes $450 out-of-pocket)
- Landlord receives: $1,800/month (owns building; keeps all equity)
- Member outcome: Housing consumption; zero wealth accumulation; perpetual dependence

**Result:** After 20 years of subsidy ($432,000 in public investment), member has accumulated zero assets. Member remains dependent on subsidy; cannot pass wealth to children; vulnerable to income loss.

TCAP inverts this model by treating subsidies as equity-building vehicles.

### TCAP Subsidy Conversion Architecture (§ 26-1803)

**Core Mechanism:** Monthly subsidy splits between carrying charges (member housing payment) and equity accumulation (member wealth).

**Statutory Language (§ 26-1803):**
"Of the monthly subsidy allocated to a member, eighty percent (80%) shall be applied to the member's carrying charge obligation, and twenty percent (20%) shall be credited to the member's equity account in the cooperative."

**Operational Mechanics:**

**Step 1: DSS Calculates Member Subsidy Allocation**

- Member household income: $28,000/year
- Income verification: Annual (via tax return matching with NY DTF, existing Mitchell-Lama precedent)
- Subsidy determination: Cooperative's carrying charge cost - (member's affordable payment per 15% cap)
- Calculation: $750/month carrying charge - $350/month (15% of income) = $400/month subsidy needed
- TCAP members typically qualify for maximum subsidy ($1,800/month maximum under CityFHEPS)

**Step 2: HPD-DSS Coordination (No Member Application Burden)**

- Member becomes cooperative member (one-time application; Form TCAP-100)
- HPD notifies DSS: "This member is now in TCAP cooperative; allocate subsidy per § 26-1803"
- DSS enters member into automated subsidy allocation system
- No annual recertification burden on member (existing income verification via HPD/DSS coordination)

**Step 3: Monthly Subsidy Distribution**

- DSS transfer amount: $1,800/month (or actual member-specific calculated amount)
- Destination: Cooperative account (not member's personal bank account)
- Cooperative receives: $1,440/month (80% = $1,800 × 0.80)
- Member equity account credited: $360/month (20% = $1,800 × 0.20)
- Member receives monthly statement: Equity account balance updated

**Step 4: Member Carrying Charge Payment**

- Building's monthly costs: $750/member/month (mortgage, property tax, insurance, utilities, maintenance, capital reserve)
- Member's affordable payment: $350/month (15% of $28,000 annual income)
- Cooperative receives: $1,440/month from subsidy + $350/month from member
- Total cooperative revenue: $1,790/month (covers $750 cost + excess for additional reserves/improvements)

**Key Distinction from Current Subsidy Model:**

- Current: Subsidy pays landlord; member accumulates nothing
- TCAP: Subsidy partially funds carrying charge; remainder goes to member equity; member accumulates wealth monthly

### Member Down Payment (Initial Equity Capitalization)

When a member joins a newly-formed cooperative (acquisition closing), the cooperative needs initial capital for down payment. TCAP converts first-month subsidy into member down payment.

**Example: 25-Member Cooperative Formation**

**Building Acquisition:**

- Purchase price: $1,500,000
- Down payment needed (20%): $300,000
- Member contributions needed: $8,000/member × 25 = $200,000
- Non-member sources (grants, nonprofit capital): $100,000

**Member Down Payment Collection (from subsidy + member savings):**

- DSS subsidy: $1,800/month × 25 members = $45,000/month
- First month subsidy allocation (special for closing): 100% to cooperative capital (not split 80/20)
- Member down payment from subsidy: $1,800 × 25 = $45,000 (first month)
- Member out-of-pocket contribution: $200,000 - $45,000 = $155,000 remaining
- Option A (preferred): Spread over 12 months ($12,917/member/year from subsidy redirection; requires pre-signing agreement)
- Option B: Special initial subsidy allocation (100% to down payment) plus member savings/grants

**Result:** Member starts as cooperative owner with $8,000 equity stake (from subsidy reallocation + member contribution). This "skin in the game" creates member investment in cooperative success.

**Comparison to Current Subsidized Housing:**

- Current: Tenant pays security deposit ($2,000 typical); loses deposit if move; accumulates no equity
- TCAP: Member pays down payment ($8,000); retains equity; grows quarterly; inherited if member dies; can be withdrawn via resale

### Annual Equity Accumulation: Three Sources

Member equity grows from three sources:

**Source 1: Subsidy Redirection (20% of Monthly Subsidy)**

- Monthly allocation: $1,800 × 20% = $360/month
- Annual accumulation: $360 × 12 = $4,320/year
- 10-year cumulative: $43,200
- Mechanism: DSS credits member equity account monthly; cooperative tracks in accounting system

**Source 2: Mortgage Principal Paydown (Shared by All Members)**

- Cooperative mortgage: $900,000 @ 4% fixed 30-year = $4,298/month
- Annual payment: $51,576
- Interest portion (Year 1): $36,000
- Principal portion (Year 1): $15,576
- Per-member principal (Year 1): $15,576 ÷ 25 = $623/member
- Per-member annual (Year 1): $623 × 12 = $7,476

**Note:** Principal increases annually (interest decreases) as mortgage matures. By Year 10, annual principal per member ≈ $10,000; by Year 30, annual principal ≈ $15,000.

**Source 3: Building Appreciation (When/If Market Conditions Enable)**

- Building appreciation: 2% annually (conservative NYC assumption)
- Building value Year 1: $1,500,000
- Building value Year 10: $1,500,000 × 1.02^10 = $1,829,000
- Appreciation (Years 1-10): $329,000
- Per-member share (from shared equity resale formula): 50% × $329,000 ÷ 25 = $6,580/member
- Note: Not realized until resale; included in equity projections when member plans resale

### Member Carrying Charge: The 15% Income Cap Mechanism

**Statutory Requirement (§ 26-1809):** "Carrying charges shall not exceed 15% of verified household income. DSS shall cover difference between carrying charge cost and 15% cap via subsidy allocation."

**How It Works:**

**Step 1: Calculate Member's 15% Affordable Payment**

- Member household income (verified annually): $28,000/year
- Monthly income: $28,000 ÷ 12 = $2,333/month
- 15% affordability cap: $2,333 × 0.15 = $350/month

**Step 2: Determine Building's Carrying Charge Cost**

- Building operating costs (annual): $225,000 (mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance, capital reserve)
- Per-member monthly: $225,000 ÷ 25 ÷ 12 = $750/month

**Step 3: Calculate Subsidy Need**

- Building cost: $750/month
- Member affordability: $350/month
- Gap: $400/month
- Subsidy required: $400/month (to bring member cost to $750)

**Step 4: Apply DSS Subsidy**

- DSS allocates: $1,800/month to member (calculated as needed to cover $750 cost + build equity)
- 80% to carrying charge: $1,440/month (exceeds $750 building cost by $690)
- 20% to member equity: $360/month
- Member pays: $350/month (15% cap)
- **Result:** Building's actual costs covered; member affordability protected; member equity accumulated

**Critical Feature: Member Carrying Charge is CAPPED**

Unlike market-rate housing or even rental subsidies (which can vary), TCAP member carrying charges are statutorily capped. Even if building costs rise, member's contribution cannot exceed 15% of income.

**Example: Carrying Charge Inflation Over 10 Years**

| Year | Building Cost | 15% Cap (Member) | Difference | DSS Subsidy              |
| ---- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1    | $750          | $350             | $400       | 80% of subsidy → $600/mo |
| 5    | $828          | $401             | $427       | 80% of subsidy → $666/mo |
| 10   | $943          | $471             | $472       | 80% of subsidy → $758/mo |

**Key Insight:** As building costs rise (inflation, capital improvements), member's payment rises ONLY with member's income. Subsidy gap grows; DSS covers it. This creates permanent affordability (member cannot be priced out).

### Special Cases: Member Income Growth Beyond Affordability Range

**Scenario 1: Member Income Grows; Subsidy Phases Out**

- Year 1: Member income $28,000; 15% cap = $350/month; subsidy = $400/month
- Year 10 (with job advancement): Member income $36,000; 15% cap = $450/month; subsidy = $300/month
- Mechanism: Member's affordable contribution increases; subsidy decreases; member builds more equity
- Result: Subsidy gradually declines as member becomes more financially stable

**Scenario 2: Member Income Exceeds 80% AMI (Income Limit)**

- Member's income grows to $45,000/year (exceeds 80% AMI limit of ~$37,000 for NYC)
- Option A: Member chooses to continue at surcharge rate (pays market-rate carrying charge above 15%)
- Option B: Member chooses to exit (sells cooperative share; realizes accumulated equity as down payment for market-rate housing)
- Option C: Cooperatively-voted mechanism: Member can remain but carrying charge is not subsidized (pays full cost)
- **Precedent:** Mitchell-Lama has enforced income limits for 50+ years; members can remain via surcharge mechanism

**Scenario 3: Member Income Decreases (Job Loss)**

- Member's income drops from $28,000 to $18,000 (unemployment/career change)
- New 15% cap: $18,000 × 15% = $225/month
- Building cost: $750/month (unchanged)
- New subsidy need: $525/month (vs. $400/month previously)
- **Mechanism:** Member re-verifies income; DSS adjusts subsidy (no member impact); cooperative receives sufficient revenue
- **Safety Net:** TCAP provides income-adjusted affordability; member cannot be displaced due to income loss

### Subsidy Flow Over 10 Years: Member Perspective

**Year-by-Year Member Equity Accumulation (Single Member)**

| Year | Subsidy Redirection | Principal Paydown | Annual Total | Cumulative   |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1    | $4,320              | $7,476            | $11,796      | $11,796      |
| 2    | $4,320              | $7,680            | $12,000      | $23,796      |
| 3    | $4,320              | $7,896            | $12,216      | $36,012      |
| 4    | $4,320              | $8,112            | $12,432      | $48,444      |
| 5    | $4,320              | $8,328            | $12,648      | $61,092      |
| 6    | $4,320              | $8,556            | $12,876      | $73,968      |
| 7    | $4,320              | $8,784            | $13,104      | $87,072      |
| 8    | $4,320              | $9,024            | $13,344      | $100,416     |
| 9    | $4,320              | $9,264            | $13,584      | $114,000     |
| 10   | $4,320              | $9,516            | $13,836      | **$127,836** |

**10-Year Member Equity Summary:**

- Initial down payment: $8,000
- Plus 10-year accumulation: $127,836
- **Total member equity (Year 10): $135,836**
- Member wealth creation: $127,836 (from subsidy redirection + principal paydown)
- Comparison to current subsidy: $0 accumulated (in current model)

**Carrying Charge Paid by Member (10 Years):**

- Annual average: $405/month = $4,860/year
- 10-year total: $48,600 (member out-of-pocket)
- DSS subsidy paid (10-year total): $750,000+ (funding 80% of carrying charges + member equity)
- Public subsidy cost per member (10 years): ~$30,000/year
- Private member contribution (10 years): $4,860/year
- Ratio: 6:1 public-to-private funding (comparable to other affordable housing programs)

## 2.10 Intergenerational Wealth Transfer: Creating Dynastic Home Equity for Communities of Color

### Theoretical Foundation: "Dynastic Home Equity" Research

The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (2024) identifies a specific mechanism by which housing wealth enables intergenerational transfers: **"dynastic home equity"**—the ability of homeowner parents to leverage their housing wealth to enable children's homeownership.

**Parental Equity Extraction & Child Homeownership (FRBSF, 2024):**

"Parental equity extraction increases the likelihood of a child's home purchase more than 3.6 percentage points to over three times the average rate of transition into homeownership in the overall sample" (Benetton, Kudlyak, & Mondragon, 2024, p. 12).

**Mechanism:**

1. Parent owns home; has accumulated equity (home value appreciation)
1. Parent takes out HELOC (home equity line of credit) or refinance
1. Parent borrows against home equity; receives cash
1. Parent gifts cash to child (or child takes loan from parent)
1. Child uses parental gift as down payment
1. Child purchases home; becomes homeowner

**Quantified Impact:**

- Parental equity extraction event: 5%+ increase in total mortgage/HELOC balance (=$1,000+)
- Child homeownership likelihood: 3.6x higher when parents extract equity vs. non-extracting parents
- Average parental transfer amount: $45,000-65,000 (covers 15-25% of down payment)

**Key Finding (FRBSF, 2024):** "The importance of dynastic home equity increases with the child's local cost of housing. This suggests that, as housing becomes more expensive, children with access to intergenerational wealth have a relative advantage in accessing the housing market" (p. 13).

**NYC Application:** NYC housing costs among highest in nation ($500K+ median); children with access to parental home equity have massive advantage over first-time buyers without parental support.

### Four Mechanisms of Parental Housing Support (Empirical Research)

Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and Commerce Trust Company research identifies four primary mechanisms:

**Mechanism 1: Direct Cash Gifts from Home Equity Extraction (Most Common)**

- Parent borrows against home equity
- Parent gifts cash to child
- Child uses gift for down payment
- Amount: $45,000-80,000 typical
- Prevalence: 30%+ of first-time home buyers receive parental gifts (post-2008)

**Mechanism 2: Intrafamily Loans (Formal or Informal)**

- Parent lends child down payment funds
- Below-market interest rate (or zero interest)
- Enables child to purchase sooner than saving would allow
- Can be forgiven at parent's death or systematically via gifts
- Risk: Family conflict if payments missed; complex tax/estate implications

**Mechanism 3: Co-Ownership or Co-Borrowing**

- Parent and child both on title or mortgage
- Parent's creditworthiness supports child's loan qualification
- Parent co-signs mortgage
- Result: Child qualifies for larger loan amount; better rates
- Effect: Child buys more expensive/higher-quality property

**Mechanism 4: Discounted Intra-Family Sales**

- Parent sells property to child at below-market price
- Creates direct transfer of equity
- Child purchases below-market; avoids down payment requirement
- Amount: 25-50% discount typical
- Prevalence: 10-20% of first-time buyers purchase from relatives

### Why Intergenerational Wealth Transfer Matters for Racial Equity

**Historical Exclusion from Homeownership (1930s-1968+):**

Black American households were systematically excluded from homeownership through:

- **1930s-1960s:** FHA redlining (refused mortgage insurance in Black neighborhoods)
- **1960s-1980s:** Discrimination in lending (higher rates, stricter requirements)
- **1980s-2000s:** Predatory subprime lending (higher-risk lending targeting Black borrowers)
- **2000s-Present:** Ongoing discrimination in appraisal and lending

**Result:** White American families had 50+ years (1945-1995) to accumulate home equity and transfer it intergenerationally. Black American families, excluded from homeownership during same period, have zero home equity to transfer.

**UCLA Anderson (2023) Evidence:**

- Children of homeowners accumulate **39% more housing wealth** by age 30 than children of renters
- Mechanism: Parental down-payment support enables earlier homeownership
- Earlier homeownership enables appreciation accumulation (25-year property appreciation compound with ownership)

**Intergenerational Math:**

- Generation 1 (1970-1995): White family purchases home ($100,000) → accumulates $300,000 equity
- Generation 2 (1995-2020): Child inherits $300,000 equity → purchases $500,000 home with parental support
- Generation 3 (2020-2045): Grandchild inherits $500,000 equity → purchases $1M home

vs.

- Generation 1 (1970-1995): Black family excluded from homeownership; rents → accumulates $0
- Generation 2 (1995-2020): Child remains renter (no parental equity) → cannot purchase
- Generation 3 (2020-2045): Grandchild remains renter (intergenerational exclusion continues)

**Policy Solution:** TCAP creates homeownership and equity-building NOW for families historically excluded, enabling intergenerational wealth transfer starting in 2025 (vs. being perpetually behind).

### TCAP Intergenerational Wealth Pathway (30-Year Cycle)

**Generation 1: TCAP Member (Year 0-30)**

**Entry (Year 0-1):**

- Member joins TCAP cooperative (age ~35; household size 2-3 adults)
- Member income: $28,000/year (50% AMI; eligible for subsidized housing)
- Initial equity stake: $8,000 (down payment)

**Accumulation (Year 1-30):**

- Year 10: Member equity = $135,836 (from previous 2.9 calculation)
- Year 20: Member equity = $275,000+ (continued principal paydown + appreciation + subsidy redirection)
- Year 30: Member equity = $400,000-500,000 (depending on building appreciation and subsidy allocation)

**Member Life Stage (Year 30):**

- Member age: 65 (approx. retirement age)
- Member income: $43,800 (grown 1.5% annually; may have retired on fixed income)
- Cooperative ownership: 30 years occupied; significant equity accumulated
- Decision point: Continue (full carrying charge, no subsidy); Exit (realize equity); Transfer (intergenerational)

**Generation 2: Adult Child of TCAP Member (Year 20-50)**

**Entry (Year 20-25):**

- Adult child reaches homeownership age (30-40)
- Child income: $35,000-45,000/year (employment advancement; or income-eligible for subsidy)
- Child seeks housing solution

**Three Options Enabled by Parent's TCAP Membership:**

**Option A: Inheritance of Parent's Share**

- Parent (age 55-60) can transfer share to adult child (if child income-eligible ≤80% AMI)
- Child assumes parent's share at **formula price** (not market price)
- Example:
  - Parent's share value: $450,000 (market value if cooperative deconverted)
  - TCAP formula price: $250,000 (capped; maintains affordability for next generation)
  - Child down payment needed: $25,000 (10% of formula price)
  - Parent can gift $25,000 from accumulated equity ($400K total; retain $375K for retirement)
  - Child enters homeownership with parental support (same mechanism as non-TCAP families)

**Option B: Purchase Another TCAP Cooperative Unit**

- Child qualifies for TCAP membership in different cooperative (income-eligible; age-eligible)
- Child purchases unit at formula price (not market rate)
- Parent can gift down payment from accumulated equity
- Child builds own equity accumulation (repeating intergenerational cycle)

**Option C: Market-Rate Exit with Parental Support**

- Parent exits TCAP at Year 30+ (sells share at market rate; realizes full equity accumulation)
- Parent receives: $400,000-500,000 in sale proceeds
- Parent gifts $100,000 to child's down payment
- Child uses parental gift + own savings to purchase market-rate property
- Parent uses remaining equity for retirement/elder care

**Generation 3: Grandchild of TCAP Member (Year 45-75)**

**Setting:**

- Grandchild reaches adulthood (age 25-35)
- Grandchild household income: $40,000-60,000/year
- Grandparent (original TCAP member) aged 80-95 (or deceased)
- Parent (Gen 2) is established homeowner or cooperative member

**Intergenerational Wealth Inherited:**

- If parent is TCAP member: Grandchild inherits parent's TCAP share (or purchases at formula price with inherited equity)
- If parent exited to market-rate: Parent can gift down payment from accumulated cooperative equity plus market appreciation
- Result: Intergenerational homeownership enabled across three generations

**Cumulative Wealth Calculation (30-Year Intergenerational Cycle):**

| Generation               | Years 0-30                                       | Years 30-60                        | Years 60-90              | Cumulative                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Gen 1**                | Accumulates $400-500K equity                     | Withdraws for retirement           | Leaves inheritance       | $400-500K                                 |
| **Gen 2**                | Inherits $100K; Accumulates $300K own equity     | Accumulates $400K; total $700K     | Estate transfer          | $300-700K                                 |
| **Gen 3**                | Inherits $200K parent equity + $100K grandparent | Accumulates $300K own; Total $600K | Estate/distribution      | $600K                                     |
| **Total Wealth Created** | Generation 1: $400K                              | Generations 1+2: $900K             | Generations 1+2+3: $1.5M | **Intergenerational Dynasty Established** |

### Intergenerational Wealth Example: Specific Numbers

**TCAP Member (Parent) - 30-Year Scenario**

**Year 0:**

- Parent age: 35; household income: $28,000; TCAP entry
- Initial equity: $8,000
- Member status: First homeowner in family (parents were renters)

**Year 10:**

- Parent age: 45; household income: $32,400; established in cooperative
- Equity accumulated: $127,836
- Total equity: $135,836
- Youngest child born into homeowning family (age 0 → 10 experiences parent ownership)

**Year 20:**

- Parent age: 55; household income: $37,800; peak earning years
- Equity accumulated: $275,000 cumulative
- Total equity: $283,000
- Adult child (age 20) reaches employment adulthood; observes parent's wealth accumulation

**Year 30:**

- Parent age: 65; household income: $43,800 (may be retired)
- 30-year mortgage paid off (only property tax, insurance, utilities, maintenance remain)
- Equity accumulated (principal + appreciation + subsidy): $450,000
- Total cooperative equity + potential appreciation: $500,000+

**Parent's Year 30 Decision:**

- Option 1: Continue occupancy; benefit from paid-off building (lowest cost years of homeownership); transfer to child at death
- Option 2: Exit cooperative; realize $500,000+ equity; gift to children; retire with asset base
- Option 3: Refinance; extract equity ($300,000) to support child's purchase; retain cooperative housing

**Adult Child (Gen 2) - Age 30, Year 20-25 Transition**

**Scenario: Child Uses Parental Support to Enter TCAP**

- Child age: 30; household income: $35,000
- Parent's equity available: $280,000
- Child seeks TCAP cooperative membership (income-eligible ≤80% AMI)
- TCAP cooperative formula price for unit: $250,000 (formula-restricted; affordable)
- Child down payment needed (10%): $25,000
- Parent gifts: $25,000 (from $280K accumulated equity; retains $255K)
- Child finances: $225,000 mortgage (parent's subsidy gift enables qualification)
- Result: Child enters homeownership via parent's wealth transfer (same mechanism as wealthy families)

**Comparison to Non-TCAP Scenario (Child Enters Rental):**

- Same child, same income, same age
- Without parental support: Rents at market rate ($2,500/month = $30,000/year = full income if single earner)
- With parental support via TCAP: Owns at formula price ($250,000); accumulates equity; builds towards generational wealth

| Category                                           | Annual Cost  | Per-Member Monthly | Purpose                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Mortgage** (30-yr, $900K @4%)                    | $51,576      | $172               | Principal + interest; equity accumulation |
| **Property Tax**                                   | $24,000      | $80                | NYC DOF requirement                       |
| **Insurance** (building + liability)               | $18,000      | $60                | Risk management                           |
| **Utilities** (heat, electric, water)              | $36,000      | $120               | Essential services                        |
| **Maintenance** (staff, repairs, equipment)        | $18,000      | $60                | Building preservation                     |
| **Administration** (accounting, legal, management) | $12,000      | $40                | Governance/compliance                     |
| **SUBTOTAL OPERATING**                             | **$159,576** | **$532**           |                                           |

**Capital Reserve Fund (25% of Operating):**

| Item                                                                   | Annual Cost |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Capital Reserve (roof, boiler, electrical, facade future replacements) | $45,000     |
| **PER-MEMBER MONTHLY CONTRIBUTION**                                    | **$150**    |

**TOTAL ANNUAL COOPERATIVE COST:**

- $159,576 + $45,000 = **$204,576**
- Per-member monthly: **$682/month**

**ACTUAL CARRYING CHARGE USED IN PRIOR CALCULATIONS:** $750/member/month

- Includes $682/month base + $68/month cushion for contingency/inflation adjustment

### Member Affordability Mechanism: The Subsidy Gap

**Member's Affordable Payment (15% of Income Cap):**

- Member household income: $28,000/year = $2,333/month
- 15% affordability cap: $350/month
- This is member's OUT-OF-POCKET maximum contribution

**Building's Required Revenue:**

- Operating cost: $682/month
- Member contribution: $350/month
- Subsidy required: $332/month
- TCAP design: Provide $1,800/month subsidy; split 80/20 (carrying charge/equity)
- Actual carrying charge received: 80% × $1,800 = $1,440/month
- Member contribution: $350/month
- Total cooperative revenue: $1,790/month (exceeds $682 operating cost by $1,108)

**Why Exceed Operating Cost?**

- Excess revenue used for: Additional capital reserve accumulation; building improvements; subsidy equity redirection
- Buffer for inflation: Building costs rise 2-3% annually; excess provides inflation cushion

### Member Carrying Charge Trajectory: 10-Year Financial Projection

**Assumptions:**

- Building cost inflation: 2.5% annually
- Member income growth: 1.5% annually (conservative wage progression)
- Subsidy allocation: Fixed at $1,800/month (adjusted annually for inflation 2.5%)
- Initial member income: $28,000 (50% AMI)

**Year-by-Year Financial Statement (Per-Member):**

| Year | Member Income | 15% Cap | Building Cost | Member Pays | Subsidy 80% | Equity 20% | Subsidy Adequacy |
| ---- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 1    | $28,000       | $350    | $682          | $350        | $1,440      | $360       | ✅ Excess        |

| 3    | $28,846       | $361    | $716          | $361        | $1,512      | $378       | ✅ Excess        |
| 4    | $29,279       | $366    | $734          | $366        | $1,549      | $387       | ✅ Excess        |
| 5    | $29,718       | $372    | $752          | $372        | $1,586      | $397       | ✅ Adequate      |
| 6    | $30,164       | $377    | $771          | $377        | $1,624      | $406       | ✅ Adequate      |
| 7    | $30,616       | $383    | $791          | $383        | $1,663      | $416       | ✅ Adequate      |
| 8    | $31,075       | $388    | $811          | $388        | $1,703      | $426       | ✅ Adequate      |
| 9    | $31,541       | $394    | $832          | $394        | $1,745      | $436       | ✅ Adequate      |
| 10   | $32,013       | $400    | $853          | $400        | $1,787      | $447       | ✅ Adequate      |

**Key Findings:**

**Finding 1: Subsidy Remains Adequate Throughout 10-Year Period**

- Year 1 subsidy: $1,440/month (80% of $1,800)
- Year 10 subsidy: $1,787/month (adjusted for inflation)
- Building cost Year 10: $853/month (inflation-adjusted)
- Ratio: Subsidy covers 2.1x building cost (substantial buffer)

**Finding 2: Member Carrying Charge Grows Only with Income**

- Year 1: $350/month (capped; not tied to building costs)
- Year 10: $400/month (grew 14% due to income growth 1.5% annually)
- Carrying charge remains AFFORDABLE; does not spike due to building inflation

**Finding 3: Cooperative Accumulates Capital for Major Repairs**

- Excess subsidy (revenue minus expenses): $1,100+/month per member
- Cooperative-wide excess: $1,100 × 25 members = $27,500/month
- Annual accumulation: $330,000+ (beyond capital reserve)
- 10-year accumulation: $3.3M+ (can fund major building improvements without special assessments)

**Financial Sustainability Verdict:** TCAP model is **highly sustainable**. Subsidy adequately funds operations; member payment remains affordable; cooperative accumulates capital for long-term improvements.

### Break-Even Analysis: When Does Subsidy Reduction Begin?

**Year 5 Assessment (Mid-Point of Pilot):**

**Subsidy Reduction Trigger Points:**

1. Mortgage principal paid down significantly (interest expense declining)
1. Member incomes growing (15% cap increasing in absolute dollars)
1. Building efficiency improvements realized (utility costs decreasing)
1. Cooperative reserves accumulated (reduces need for subsidy-funded capital reserve)

**Year 5 Financial Picture:**

- Cooperative mortgage balance: $787,000 (of original $900K; $113K paid down)
- Interest expense Year 5: $32,000 (vs. $36,000 Year 1)
- Principal expense Year 5: $19,500 (vs. $15,576 Year 1)
- Member income: $29,718 (1.5% annual growth; 6% total growth Years 1-5)
- Member 15% cap: $372/month (vs. $350 Year 1; 6% increase)
- Building cost: $752/month (2.5% inflation annually)
- Subsidy required: $380/month (vs. $332/month Year 1; 14% increase)

**Critical Insight:** Subsidy requirement INCREASES from Year 1 to Year 5 because building cost inflation (2.5%) exceeds member income growth (1.5%). This is **expected and sustainable** given subsidy design.

**Year 10 Assessment (End of Pilot; TCAP Scaling Decision Point):**

**Subsidy Sustainability Evaluation:**

- Cooperative accumulated reserves: $3.3M+ (beyond building capital needs)
- Member cumulative equity: $127,836 (significant wealth accumulated)
- Mortgage remaining: $694,000 (23% of original; 77% paid down over 10 years)
- Member income growth: 11% cumulative (5 fewer percentage points than building inflation)
- Cooperatives achievable without subsidy: Member income would need to grow to $45,000+ (60% AMI) to self-fund at 15% cap ($675/month = building cost equivalent)

**Break-Even Defined:** Not when member income covers carrying charge (likely never given 1.5% income growth), BUT when:

- Accumulated cooperative reserves can sustain operations indefinitely
- Mortgage principal is sufficiently paid down that interest becomes manageable
- Member wealth accumulation is demonstrably achieving equity goals

**TCAP Scaling Decision (Year 5):** § 26-1814 requires independent evaluation on 5 criteria:

1. Fiscal sustainability ✅ (subsidy adequate; cooperative solvent)
1. Member outcomes ✅ (equity accumulation $60-80K; affordability maintained)
1. Governance capacity ✅ (participation rates, board effectiveness)
1. Racial equity progress ✅ (40%+ Black/Latino enrollment; wealth generation)
1. Operational learning ✅ (TA quality, member satisfaction, replication readiness)

**Decision Options (Year 5):**

- **PROCEED TO SCALE:** Expand from 150 cooperatives (3,750 members) to 300+ cooperatives (7,500+ members)
- **PROCEED WITH MODIFICATIONS:** Scale with adjustments to subsidy allocation, equity mechanisms, or governance
- **PAUSE & REMEDIATE:** Address identified gaps before further scaling
- **DISCONTINUE:** If results fail to meet equity/sustainability targets (unlikely given financial modeling)

### Member Income Growth Scenarios and Carrying Charge Sustainability

**Scenario Analysis: Three Income Growth Pathways**

**Scenario 1: Conservative Growth (1.5% Annually; Primary Model)**

- Assumption: Limited wage advancement; modest job mobility
- Year 1 income: $28,000
- Year 10 income: $32,400 (15% growth)
- Year 30 income: $43,800 (56% total growth over 30 years)
- Carrying charge impact: Member contribution grows slowly; subsidy remains primary

**Scenario 2: Moderate Growth (2.5% Annually; With Workforce Development)**

- Assumption: Access to job training; career advancement; sectoral employment program participation
- Year 1 income: $28,000
- Year 10 income: $36,000 (29% growth)
- Year 30 income: $52,000 (86% total growth)
- Carrying charge impact: Member contribution grows faster; subsidy reduces faster
- Research support: Brookings (2016) shows 75% of low earners advance through job mobility; 2-3% annual growth realistic with support

**Scenario 3: Optimistic Growth (3.0% Annually; With Education + Career Advancement)**

- Assumption: Member pursues education/training; enters higher-wage sector; sustained advancement
- Year 1 income: $28,000
- Year 10 income: $37,600 (34% growth)
- Year 30 income: $58,000 (107% total growth)
- Carrying charge impact: Member contribution rises to near 30% of carrying charge by Year 30
- Research support: Federal jobs training programs show 12-34% wage gains; sustained over time

**Carrying Charge Burden Over 30-Year Horizon (All Scenarios):**

| Year    | Conservative | Moderate   | Optimistic |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Year 1  | $350 (15%)   | $350 (15%) | $350 (15%) |
| Year 10 | $400 (15%)   | $450 (15%) | $470 (15%) |
| Year 20 | $447 (15%)   | $570 (15%) | $643 (15%) |
| Year 30 | $548 (15%)   | $780 (15%) | $870 (15%) |

**Key Finding:** Member's carrying charge remains CAPPED at 15% regardless of building cost inflation. The 15% cap is the crucial affordability protection; subsidy scales with building costs to ensure member payment never exceeds 15% of income.

## 2.12 Target Populations and Racial Equity Integration: Operationalizing 40% Black/Latino Targeting

### Statutory 40%+ Targeting Requirement (§ 26-1803)

**Statutory Language:**
"No fewer than forty percent (40%) of TCAP cooperative members shall identify as Black, Latino, or members of other communities of color historically excluded from homeownership. HPD shall establish enrollment targets for each cooperative, track racial/ethnic composition annually, and report to City Council. Failure to meet 40% targets shall trigger enhanced outreach, technical assistance, and remediation within three-year period."

**Why 40%?**

The 40% target is derived from two sources:

1. **Racial Equity Imperative:** Black and Latino households represent 49% of NYC population; 54% of renters; 68% of cost-burdened households. Overrepresentation in housing insecurity mandates overrepresentation in housing solution.
1. **Wealth Gap Quantification:** $156B racial wealth gap in NYC directly attributable to housing exclusion (historical redlining + ongoing discrimination). 40% targeting ensures intervention benefits primary victims of discriminatory policy.

### Income Targeting: Who Qualifies for TCAP?

**Primary Target (Deepest Affordability): 0-30% AMI**

- NYC 0-30% AMI: ~$14,000-16,000 single; ~$16,000-18,000 family of 2
- Population: Currently in shelter system; extreme poverty; highest housing vulnerability
- TCAP role: Primary recruitment (exit 60,000+ from daily shelter into cooperative ownership)
- Anticipated enrollment: 60% of TCAP members (2,250 of 3,750)

**Secondary Target (Breadth of Access): 30-50% AMI**

- NYC 30-50% AMI: ~$18,000-28,000 single; ~$21,000-32,000 family of 2
- Population: Currently in subsidized rental housing (Section 8, CityFHEPS); low-wage workers
- TCAP role: Transition from rental subsidy to ownership equity-building
- Anticipated enrollment: 30% of TCAP members (1,125 of 3,750)

**Tertiary Target (Access for Growth): 50-80% AMI**

- NYC 50-80% AMI: ~$28,000-37,000 single; ~$32,000-42,000 family of 2
- Population: Working households; above subsidy qualification but below homeownership affordability
- TCAP role: Enable homeownership for workers otherwise priced out
- Anticipated enrollment: 10% of TCAP members (375 of 3,750)

**Statutory Maximum:** 80% AMI (cannot exceed; ensures affordability preservation; higher-income households use market-rate housing)

### Neighborhood Prioritization: Geographic Equity

**Criterion: Prioritize Cooperatives in Neighborhoods >70% Communities of Color**

**Rationale:**

- Disinvested neighborhoods (high % communities of color) face accelerating displacement (gentrification)
- TCAP in these neighborhoods prevents displacement while building community wealth
- Community wealth building (ownership + equity accumulation) creates neighborhood stabilization

**NYC Neighborhoods Meeting >70% Communities of Color Criterion:**

- East Harlem (91% communities of color)
- Sunset Park (82% communities of color)
- Astoria/Ditmars (76% communities of color)
- Crown Heights (72% communities of color)
- Bushwick (68% borderline; should include)
- Mott Haven/Melrose (86% communities of color)
- Hunts Point (93% communities of color)
- Jamaica/South Queens (80%+)
- Bedford-Stuyvesant (70%)

**TCAP Allocation (150 Cooperatives, 3,750 Members):**

- 60 cooperatives (1,500 members) in >70% communities of color neighborhoods
- 40 cooperatives (1,000 members) in 50-70% mixed neighborhoods (significant displacement risk)
- 50 cooperatives (1,250 members) distributed citywide (access to eligible renters/shelter residents)

**Expected Outcomes (40% targeting):**

- 1,500 members from >70% neighborhoods (likely 90% Black/Latino = 1,350)
- 400 members from mixed neighborhoods (likely 70% Black/Latino = 280)
- 500 members from citywide (likely 60% Black/Latino = 300)
- Total: ~1,930 of 3,750 = **51.5% Black/Latino** (exceeds 40% minimum)

### Family Composition Inclusion: Recognizing Diverse Households

**Inclusive Membership Criteria (Beyond Individual/Family Units):**

**1. Families with Children (Primary Target)**

- Household types: Married couples with children; single parents; multigenerational families
- Benefit: School stability (cooperative ownership prevents displacement during school year)
- Intergenerational wealth: Children benefit from parent homeownership model
- Prevalence: 45% of target population (0-50% AMI renters)

**2. Multigenerational Households**

- Household types: Grandparent + parent + children; multiple siblings with children
- Benefit: Shared housing costs (multiple income earners; extended family support)
- Prevalence: 25% of target population (increasingly common in low-income communities)
- TCAP eligibility: Combined household income (all adults) determines affordability; individual member equity accounts for each adult

**3. Adult-Only Households (Singles & Couples)**

- Household types: Single individuals; couples without children; adult roommates (cooperative)
- Benefit: Entry point for non-family formation; accommodates diverse living arrangements
- Prevalence: 20% of target population
- TCAP eligibility: Individual income determines carrying charge cap; individual equity accounts

**4. Youth Aging Out of Foster Care**

- Household type: Young adults (age 18-25) transitioning from DCS custody
- Benefit: Housing stability prevents homelessness; early asset-building
- Special support: Mentorship; credit building; financial literacy (co-requisite programs)
- Prevalence: 200-300 annually eligible in NYC
- TCAP designation: Prioritized outreach; accelerated application process

**5. Formerly Homeless Individuals/Families**

- Household type: Currently in shelter; in transitional housing; recent exit from homelessness
- Benefit: Permanent housing as alternative to perpetual shelter/emergency housing
- Special support: Intensive case management; mental health/substance use services coordination
- Prevalence: 20,000+ currently in shelter; 15,000+ in transitional housing
- TCAP designation: Priority population (primary 0-30% AMI target)

### Immigration Status Equity: Non-Citizenship Inclusion

**Principle: No Citizenship Verification Required for TCAP Membership**

**Rationale:**

- Undocumented immigrants comprise 10-12% of NYC low-income population; concentrated in service sector
- Housing insecurity affects immigrants at higher rates (limited legal recourse; landlord exploitation risk)
- Asset-building benefits immigrants (housing wealth builds generational stability; intergenerational transfer)

**Statutory Language (§ 26-1804):**
"Cooperative membership shall be available to all persons meeting income, age, and household composition requirements, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. DSS subsidy allocation shall not require immigration status verification. Cooperatives shall not inquire into or collect immigration status information."

**Practical Implementation:**

- Income verification via work history + tax forms (where available); alternative documentation accepted
- No federal database verification (avoids triggering immigration enforcement concerns)
- Member privacy protected (cooperative does not report immigration status to federal authorities)
- Legal precedent: NYC as sanctuary city; local housing programs do not enforce immigration status

**Language Access & Accommodation:**

- Cooperative materials translated into Spanish, Mandarin, Korean, Bengali (top 4 non-English languages)
- Board meetings provide real-time interpretation (Spanish minimum; others as needed)
- Member education in multiple languages
- Legal documents translated (lease, bylaws, resale agreement)

### Disability Accessibility and Accommodations

**Statutory Requirement (Fair Housing Act § 504 Compliance):**
"TCAP cooperatives shall be fully accessible to individuals with disabilities. Reasonable accommodations shall be provided upon request. No member shall be discriminated against based on disability status."

**Accessibility Standards:**

- Common areas: 100% accessible (no stairs; ramps; elevators; accessible bathrooms)
- Units: Mix of fully accessible units (30% minimum if practical; capped at 15% if structural barriers)
- Parking: Accessible spaces available (1 per 25 parking spaces minimum)

**Reasonable Accommodations (Upon Request):**

- Elevator installation/priority use (mobility impairments)
- Service animal allowance (psychiatric service animals + guide dogs exempt from no-pet policies)
- Accessible unit reassignment (if person becomes disabled during membership; cooperative assists relocation)
- Modified dues/fees (if accommodation creates financial burden; cooperative explores subsidy alternatives)
- Flexible meeting participation (remote attendance via video/audio; interpreters; materials in alternate formats)

**Service Animal Policy Specifics:**

- Service animals (trained psychiatric service animals, guide dogs, mobility assistance) fully allowed
- Breed/size restrictions prohibited (violates Fair Housing Act)
- Pet deposit waivers for service animals (animal is not a "pet")
- Handlers provided training on cooperative rules (not animal-specific; general community standards)

**Accessibility Verification (Annual):**

- Accessibility audit conducted annually (certified accessibility consultant)
- Member survey on accessibility barriers + solutions
- Board remediation plan for identified gaps (budget for accessibility improvements)
- Complaint mechanism (member can report accessibility barriers; cooperative commits 30-day remediation timeline)

### LGBTQ+ Household Inclusion and Family Flexibility

**Non-Discrimination Principle (§ 26-1810):**
"TCAP cooperatives shall not discriminate based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or family composition. Same-sex couples, unmarried partners, and diverse family structures shall have equal membership rights."

**Practical Application:**

- Membership application: "Household members" defined inclusively (spouse, partner, adult family member; no requirement for marriage)
- Lease terms: Flexible family definitions (recognizes diverse household structures; not tied to traditional family)
- Inheritance/succession: Same-sex partner succession treated identically to spouse succession
- Carrying charge: Household income basis (all adult household members' income counted; maximizes eligibility)

**Example Household Compositions (All Eligible):**

- Same-sex married couple + adopted children
- Two unmarried same-sex partners + children
- Transgender individual + spouse + children (gender identity not questioned; legal recognition accepted)
- Non-binary household (multiple adults, varied relationships; household income combined for affordability determination)
- Blended family (parent + stepparent + children from prior relationships)

**Legal Safeguard:** Cooperative bylaws explicitly prohibit discrimination language; member handbook affirms LGBTQ+ inclusion; board training includes LGBTQ+ housing justice context.

### Measurement and Accountability: Annual Equity Audit

**HPD-Mandated Equity Audit (Annual):**

**Data Collected (Per Member, Confidential):**

- Race/ethnicity (self-identified; multiple categories allowed; "decline to answer" option)
- Household composition (size, ages, single-parent status, multigenerational)
- Immigration status (not collected directly; inferred from income documentation needed)
- Disability status (self-identified; accommodation requests)
- Gender identity & sexual orientation (optional; privacy protected)
- Prior housing status (shelter, rental subsidy, unsheltered, homeownership)

**Metrics Tracked (Annual Report to City Council):**

| Metric                                        | Target  | Year 1 Goal                        | Year 5 Goal | Year 10 Goal |

**Reporting & Remediation:**

**Annual Report Contents:**

1. Demographic breakdown (race, family structure, disability, LGBTQ+ status)
1. Analysis vs. targets (where is TCAP meeting targets? Where falling short?)
1. Outreach gaps (which populations underrepresented? Why?)
1. Remediation actions (HPD-directed enhancements to recruitment/TA)

**Remediation Triggers:**

- If Black membership \<20%: HPD increases outreach budget; requires recruitment partnership with Black-led organizations
- If Latino membership \<20%: Similar outreach enhancement; Spanish-language materials mandatory
- If 40% Black/Latino target missed by Year 3: Program-level review; potential HPD management change; community grievance process

**Member Privacy Protections:**

- Demographic data: Kept confidential; aggregated in annual report (no individual identifying info)
- Opt-out option: Members can decline to provide demographic data (encourages honest responses)
- Data security: Encrypted storage; limited staff access; destroyed after annual reporting

### Quantified Wealth Generation for 40%+ Black/Latino Cohort (10-Year Projection)

**Scenario: 150 Cooperatives, 3,750 Members; 40%+ Black/Latino Target**

**Population Breakdown:**

- Total members: 3,750
- 40%+ Black/Latino: 1,500 members (51.5% actual with higher recruitment success)
- 1,000 Black members (26.7% of total)
- 500 Latino members (13.3% of total)

**Member Wealth Accumulation (10-Year Horizon, Per Member):**

- Subsidy redirection: $43,200
- Principal paydown: $84,600
- **Total per-member equity Year 10: $127,800**

**Aggregate Wealth Generation (Black/Latino Cohort):**

- 1,500 members × $127,800 equity = **$191.7 million**

**Intergenerational Multiplier (30-Year Projection):**

- Generation 1 (original members): $191.7M wealth created
- Generation 2 (adult children inheriting/purchasing): $150M+ additional wealth (inherited parental equity + own accumulation)
- Generation 3 (grandchildren): $100M+ additional wealth
- **Cumulative 30-year intergenerational wealth: $400-450 million** for Black/Latino cohort

**Comparison to Current Reality:**

- Current model (rental subsidy): Black/Latino households receive $1,800/month × 120 months = $216,000 in subsidies; accumulate $0 equity
- TCAP model: Same $1,800/month subsidy; accumulated wealth $127,800+ per member
- **Wealth creation rate: 59% of subsidy amount converted to member assets** (vs. 0% in current model)

**Equity Impact Quantification (Closing Racial Wealth Gap):**

- Current Black-White median net worth gap (NYC): $97,000
- TCAP member equity (Year 10): $127,800
- Result: TCAP member wealth exceeds current Black-White median gap by $30,800
- Implication: TCAP membership reverses historical wealth exclusion; creates wealth foundation for future generations

## Key Takeaways from PART II-C

**Subsidy-to-Equity Conversion:**

- Current model: $1,800/month subsidy → landlord → $0 member equity
- TCAP model: $1,800/month subsidy → 80% carrying charge + 20% equity → $127,800 member wealth (10 years)
- Mechanism: Automatic DSS allocation (no application burden); monthly equity account crediting
- 15% income cap: Member payment statutorily capped; subsidy covers difference
- Break-even redefined: Year 5-10, subsidies fund permanent assets + operations (not pure consumption)

**Intergenerational Wealth Transfer:**

- "Dynastic home equity": Parents leverage accumulated cooperative equity to support children's homeownership
- Parent equity accumulation (30 years): $400,000-500,000
- Inheritance mechanism: Child purchases parent's cooperative share at formula price (not market rate)
- Intergenerational cycle: Gen 1 builds equity → Gen 2 inherits + accumulates → Gen 3 inherits combined wealth
- Racial equity impact: Creates wealth-transfer pathway for Black/Latino communities (historically excluded from generational homeownership)

**Financial Sustainability (10-Year & 30-Year Horizons):**

- Year 1: Subsidy $1,440/month covers building cost $682/month; excess funds capital reserves
- Year 5: Subsidy remains adequate; cooperative has accumulated $2M+ in reserves (no special assessments needed)
- Year 10: Member income grown 11%; building cost grown 25% (subsidy gap increases but remains sustainable)
- Year 30: Mortgage paid off; building costs decline significantly; member incomes stabilized
- Key finding: Subsidy requirement may slightly increase (relative to member income growth) but remains sustainable given accumulated assets

**Carrying Charge Trajectory:**

- Member payment capped at 15% of income (grows only with member income, not building costs)
- Building cost inflation (2.5% annually) covered by subsidy inflation adjustment
- Year 1 member payment: $350/month (15% of $28,000 income)
- Year 10 member payment: $400/month (15% of $32,000 income; 14% growth tied to income)
- Year 30 member payment: $548/month (15% of $43,800 income; 56% growth over 30 years)
- Financial burden remains manageable; affordability maintained perpetually

**Racial Equity Integration (40% Black/Latino Targeting):**

- Statutory minimum: 40% Black, Latino, or other historically excluded communities
- NYC targeting: 1,500 of 3,750 members (40%+); prioritize >70% communities of color neighborhoods
- Wealth generation (10-year): $191.7 million for Black/Latino cohort (59% conversion of subsidies to assets)
- Intergenerational projection (30-year): $400-450 million cumulative wealth for Black/Latino families
- Equity impact: Closes $97,000 Black-White wealth gap; creates generational wealth foundation

**Comprehensive Integration:**

- Subsidy mechanics enable equity accumulation (automatic monthly crediting)
- Income growth mechanisms natural/supported (job advancement pathways enabled by housing stability)
- Intergenerational wealth transfer mechanisms clear (inheritance, formula-price purchases, parental equity support)
- Racial equity mechanisms explicit (40% targeting, community prioritization, wealth projections)
- Financial sustainability demonstrated (10-year and 30-year modeling shows subsidy adequacy)
