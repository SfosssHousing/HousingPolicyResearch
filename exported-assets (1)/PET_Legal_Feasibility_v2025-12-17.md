# Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework  
## Legal Feasibility Memo – v2025-12-17

---

## Executive Summary

The Public Equity Transfer (PET) framework is legally feasible under existing NYC, NYS, and federal authorities, provided that **transfer mechanisms avoid ANCP-style pass-through entities** that dilute low-income purpose protections. This memo identifies statutory guardrails, principal risks, and required administrative/legislative actions to execute PET safely across three pillars: (1) Article XI HDFC conversion authority, (2) Title VI/Fair Housing compliance, and (3) ADA/504 accessibility and civil-rights protections.

**Bottom line:** PET can be designed to satisfy low-income housing purpose requirements while enabling resident equity ownership, but only if:
- In rem / HDFC property transfers remain directly held by tenants or their direct cooperative entities (not pass-through HDFC shells like "Restoring Communities HDFC" used under ANCP).
- Reliance on federal subsidies is capped at a stated percentage of resident debt obligations.
- Racial equity impact statements accompany major zoning or property-disposition actions.

## 1. Legal Landscape: NYC Article XI & PHFL

### 1.1 Article XI – HDFC Housing Purpose

**Statute:** NY Private Housing Finance Law (PHFL) Article XI, §236–237.

**Core constraint:** Any HDFC corporation must be created "for the purpose of developing a housing project for persons of low income."  HDFC shares in perpetuity are restricted to low-income households (≤ 100–120% AMI depending on program).

**Key finding:** Article XI does **not prohibit** resident equity accrual within an HDFC coop. The statute prescribes **ownership structure** (coop, not condo) and **income targeting** (must remain ≤ stated AMI at resale) but is **silent on internal equity pools** or share-appreciation mechanisms if they do not violate the low-income purpose.

### 1.2 ANCP as Negative Control: Restoring Communities HDFC

**Problem:** Under ANCP, HPD created "Restoring Communities HDFC" as a pass-through entity to hold title during rehabilitation, then transfer to private developers who convert former TIL tenants into mixed-income cooperatives (current residents low-income, new units moderate-income 100–120% AMI).

**Legal risk flagged in prior audit:** While Restoring Communities is nominally an HDFC, it functions as a shell to circumvent the original PHFL Article XI requirement that warehoused TIL units—once conveyed through an HDFC—remain reserved for low-income persons. Instead, ANCP terms allow currently vacant units to be sold to above-120% AMI buyers if "non-city financing" is used, potentially sidestepping Article XI low-income designation.

**PET design rule:** Do not replicate Restoring Communities pass-through model. Any PET-enabled equity conversion must:
- Transfer directly to a tenant-controlled HDFC (no intermediate shell).
- Legally bind all units—including previously vacant/warehoused—to Article XI low-income income limits in perpetuity, or establish a CLT ground lease with equivalent restrictions.

## 2. Federal Subsidy Integration & Title VI Risk

### 2.1 Source of Income (SOI) Discrimination

**Law:** NYC Administrative Code § 8–107(26). HPD/HRA enforcement via DSS SOI Unit.

**PET implication:** Households receiving PET equity-investment shares are simultaneously participating in federal rental-assistance programs (Section 8, CityFHEPS). Landlords / cooperative boards cannot discriminate against PET households based on this dual status.

**Compliance action:** PET intake workflows must include SOI discrimination warnings and reporting pathways (DSS 929-221-6576) consistent with Open Doors guidance.

### 2.2 Title VI & Fair Housing

**Statute:** Title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964; Fair Housing Act (FHA) 42 U.S.C. § 3604.

**PET risk:** If PET is targeted to neighborhoods or building cohorts in ways that create racial disparate impact (e.g., overwhelmingly siting PET conversions in low-Black/Latino neighborhoods while excluding high-opportunity areas), it triggers Title VI and FHA scrutiny.

**Mitigation:**
- Require racial equity impact statement (per NYC rezoning advocacy practice) before major PET neighborhood or portfolio rollouts.
- Use stratified random sampling or explicit equity-balancing across race and place when selecting pilot buildings.
- Document intent and outcomes disaggregated by race/ethnicity in annual PET reports.

## 3. ADA & Section 504 Compliance

### 3.1 Accessibility in Building Rehabilitation

**Statute:** Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Title II, 28 CFR Part 35; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 CFR Part 1613.

**PET design issue:** Many warehoused TIL buildings have failed code enforcement on accessibility (leaky roofs, broken elevators, rat infestations). When PET triggers capital rehabilitation, ADA/504 obligations activate.

**Compliance action:**
- Any building receiving city capital or financing (via PET equity redirection) must meet ADA Title II/504 accessibility standards or have a binding remediation timeline.
- Do not use equity-share structures to excuse accessibility delays.
- Budget accessibility costs separately in ROI model (not absorbed by tenant equity).

### 3.2 Occupancy & Reasonable Accommodations

**Risk:** PET bylaws and equity-share vesting schedules must not impose barriers to reasonable accommodations (e.g., extended tenure for disability-related absences, family size changes due to guardianship).

**Compliance action:** PET legal templates must explicitly preserve ADA/504 accommodation pathways and include language that equity vesting and occupancy rights are not conditioned on disability status.

---

## 4. Statutory / Administrative Changes Required

### 4.1 NYC Administration Code – HPD Authority

**Current:** HPD carries authority to sell or manage in rem property (§ 11–112). Does not explicitly permit equity-investment redirects of housing funds.

**Required change (or interpretation):** Add § 11–112.1 permitting HPD to:
- Redirect rental-subsidy funds into resident equity pools within cooperative or CLT entities.
- Execute equity-share agreements alongside or instead of traditional voucher terms.
- Set underwriting standards for PET household eligibility based on income and credit risk.

### 4.2 HRA Operations – CityFHEPS Integration

**Current:** CityFHEPS is a rental-assistance grant program (NYC Admin Code § 21–403).

**Required change (or interpretation):** Add language permitting HRA to:
- Recognize PET equity-investment shares as a **component** of household subsidy packages, not a replacement.
- Allow simultaneous receipt of CityFHEPS payment + PET equity accrual (e.g., city pays 70% of rent directly to coop; household uses 30% tenant payment + PET share accrual to build equity).
- Maintain case-management services and Right-to-Counsel access across PET participant households.

### 4.3 Credit Union Authorization

**Current:** NY Banking Law § 130 permits credit unions to provide financing to members.

**PET design:** Credit unions are proposed as the primary vehicle for member-coop lending under PET. This is permissible under existing law if:
- Credit union bylaws include low-income housing as a defined part of their community development mission.
- Loan underwriting does not impose income or credit barriers inconsistent with HUD definitions.

**Recommended action:** Produce model bylaws for PET-participating credit unions; coordinate with NY Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) credit union supervisor for guidance letter confirming PET loan products comply with § 130.

## 5. Article XI Perpetuity & Exit Risk

### 5.1 Perpetuity Clause Problem

**Issue:** Article XI restricts HDFC shares in perpetuity. Once a household buys into a PET-enabled HDFC (even with equity subsidy), they are bound to low-income resale-price limits forever.

**Tension with equity narrative:** If PET is framed as a **wealth-building** program, households may expect to capture appreciation or exit at market rates. Article XI prevents this.

**Mitigation:**
- Be transparent in all PET disclosure documents: equity shares are **controlled-appreciation** shares, not market-rate wealth.
- Model realistic long-term equity scenarios (e.g., 1–2% annual appreciation capped).
- Explore **exit pathways** if a household's income rises above low-income limits (e.g., buy-out to market coop, or gradual equity-share buyback).

### 5.2 Intergenerational Succession

**Issue:** Article XI does not automatically permit children of deceased HDFC shareholders to inherit the share at low-income resale price.

**TIL history:** HPD's succession-rights disputes (granting 30-day windows to bereaved families) created conflicts with Article XI interpretation.

**Mitigation:**
- PET bylaws must **explicitly permit** succession rights for immediate family (spouse, children, parents) inheriting an HDFC share, contingent on income eligibility.
- Establish a **pre-succession documentation process** during the shareholder's lifetime (power-of-attorney, will-transfer, etc.) to avoid delays.

## 6. Racial Equity & Community Power

### 6.1 Rezoning Equity Assessment Practice

**Context:** NYC Public Advocate advocacy for racial equity assessment in land-rezoning (Int. 1572–2019) emphasizes anti-displacement, anti-gentrification, and community control.

**PET parallel:** While PET is not a rezoning, major neighborhood-scale PET rollouts (e.g., converting 20+ warehoused TIL buildings in East Harlem) should include:
- Racial equity impact statement (as precedent from rezoning debates).
- Community engagement with existing tenant associations (not just new PET participants).
- Commitment that PET does not accelerate displacement or gentrify buildings for outside investment.

**Legal grounding:** No current statute mandates racial equity statements for housing programs, but the practice is well-established in planning contexts. Including racial equity statements preemptively defends against Title VI/FHA disparate-impact challenges.

---

## 7. Federal Subsidy Volatility Risk

### 7.1 Section 8 Cuts & Debt Service Sustainability

**Precedent:** In 2009, NYC Section 8 vouchers were closed to new enrollees; in 2013, HUD cuts forced senior-housing relocations from larger to smaller units.

**PET risk:** If PET tenant-owners become dependent on federal subsidies for 60–80% of maintenance costs (as in ANCP), sudden subsidy cuts strand them with unaffordable debt obligations.

**Mitigation:**
- Cap city reliance on federal subsidies for PET debt service at **≤ 50% of any resident maintenance charge.**
- Establish a **PET Emergency Subsidy Reserve Fund** (seeded from HPD operational savings) to cover temporary federal-subsidy gaps.
- Include explicit **federal-policy risk language** in PET disclosure and equity agreements.

---

## 8. Right-to-Counsel Integration

### 8.1 Existing OCJ / Universal Access Infrastructure

**Law:** NYC Admin Code § 21–405 (Right to Counsel); OCJ funded by HRA.

**PET opportunity:** Right-to-Counsel providers (legal services nonprofits across all 5 boroughs) can be integrated into PET intake:
- Provide free legal review of PET equity-share agreements before household executes.
- Advise on Article XI restrictions, succession rights, and default consequences.
- Represent households in equity-dispute resolution with cooperatives or lenders.

**Budget action:** Require PET implementation plan to allocate 2–3% of redirected subsidy funds to OCJ for PET-specific legal services (consistent with current Right-to-Counsel funding model).

---

## 9. Staffing & Capacity for Civil-Rights Compliance

### 9.1 Equity Impact Review

**Current gap:** HRA/HPD do not have dedicated racial equity or disparate-impact analytics units.

**Required:** Create or contract a **civil-rights review team** that:
- Evaluates PET pilot selection, outcomes, and reporting disaggregated by race, ethnicity, disability, and family status.
- Flags disparate impacts early and recommends course corrections.
- Produces annual PET civil-rights compliance report to HPD Commissioner and HRA Commissioner.

## Conclusion

**PET is legally feasible.** Provided that:

1. **Transfers avoid ANCP pass-throughs:** Direct to tenant-controlled HDFC or CLT, with perpetual low-income restrictions.
2. **Federal subsidy reliance is capped:** ≤ 50% of resident debt obligations, with volatility insurance.
3. **Civil-rights protections are embedded:** SOI, Title VI, ADA/504 compliance; racial equity impact statements; Right-to-Counsel access.
4. **Statutory/administrative changes are adopted:** NYC Admin Code amendments, HRA reinterpretation, and NYDFS guidance.

The legal risks are **manageable but material.** Execution requires close coordination between CPD, HPD, HRA, credit unions, and civil-rights oversight throughout implementation.
