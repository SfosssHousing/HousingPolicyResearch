## KEY ADDITIONS SINCE COPA PASSAGE ASSUMPTION:

### § 26-1815: TCAP-COPA Integration Clause
Explicitly recognizes COPA (Intro 902-A) as complementary right-to-purchase mechanism; ensures:
- Tenant associations recognized under COPA receive priority TOF financing
- 45-day notice + 90-day negotiation periods coordinate with TCAP timelines
- TCAP affordability covenants apply to all COPA-acquired buildings
- Integrated implementation pathway: COPA identifies distressed buildings → TCAP provides financing/TA/subsidy conversion

### TOPETA (Local Law C) EXPANSION
- Extends right-to-purchase beyond COPA to include foreclosures, tax lien sales, receiverships
- Provides financing and TA support specifically for tenant-led acquisitions
- Creates private right of action + 3% purchase price penalty for non-compliance

### Scaling Decision Gate (§ 26-1814)
- Year 5 (2030) independent evaluation on 5 criteria:
  * Fiscal sustainability (costs, savings, ROI)
  * Member outcomes (retention, affordability, equity)
  * Governance capacity (structure, diversity, satisfaction)
  * Racial equity progress (40%+ Black/Latino target)
  * Operational learning (rulemaking, coordination, TA quality)
- Decision outcomes: PROCEED TO SCALE / PROCEED WITH MODIFICATIONS / PAUSE & REMEDIATE / DISCONTINUE
- Task Force votes with public hearing
