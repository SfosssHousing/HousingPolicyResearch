## 5.1 Legal Foundations: Current TOPA/COPA Landscape

### 5.1.1 NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902/902-A)

On the cusp of enactment, NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902, amended as Intro 902-A in December 2025) establishes the basic acquisition framework that TCAP will leverage (New York City Council, 2024; Matthews, 2025).

**Key Provisions of Intro 902-A:**(Matthews, 2025; New York City Council, 2024)

- **Covered Properties:** Four or more-unit buildings, or vacant lots that can accommodate four or more-unit buildings, plus buildings where affordability restrictions have expired or are set to expire within two years, including 421-a, 485-g, 485-x, and Affordable NY buildings (Matthews, 2025).

- **Notice & Timeline:**

  - Owner must provide written notice to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) at least 5 days before taking any action that would result in the sale of the property (Matthews, 2025).
  - Qualified entities have 45 days to submit a statement of interest in the property (New York City Council, 2024).
  - Qualified entities then have an exclusive 90-day period to submit a competitive offer to purchase (New York City Council, 2024).
  - During this exclusive period, owners cannot accept third-party offers (Matthews, 2025).

- **Right of First Refusal:** If a nonprofit's initial offer is rejected, the nonprofit retains a right of first refusal on any third-party offer received within one year; owner must notify HPD and the nonprofit within 15 days of receiving such an offer, and the nonprofit has 15 days to exercise its matching purchase right (Matthews, 2025).

- **Qualified Entities:** HPD will designate qualifying nonprofits, community land trusts, and other entities through rulemaking; currently includes NYC's designated Qualified Preservation Buyers, plus emerging community land trusts and cooperative sponsors (New York City Community Land Initiative, 2024).

- **Noncompliance Penalties:** Owners who fail to comply with COPA provisions face civil penalties of at least 3% of the building's purchase price and may face injunctive relief from qualified entities (Matthews, 2025).

**TCAP Integration Point:**
TCAP cooperatives and their sponsoring nonprofits will be explicitly recognized in HPD's "Qualified Entity" rulemaking under Intro 902-A, allowing tenant associations and TCAP-ready cooperatives to receive first-purchase rights. This positions TCAP as a natural vehicle for COPA acquisitions, rather than as a separate legal track (New York City Council, 2024; New York City Community Land Initiative, 2024).

### 5.1.2 New York State Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (S.401)

Pending state-level passage, New York Senate Bill S.401 Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (2025) would establish tenant purchase rights statewide, modeled on the District of Columbia's 45-year-old TOPA statute enacted in 1980 (New York State Senate, 2025; New York State Assembly, 2025).

**S.401 Key Provisions (2025):**(New York State Assembly, 2025)

- **Applicability:** All residential multifamily properties, with exemptions for government-owned buildings, dormitories, hotels, existing housing cooperatives, and condominiums (New York State Assembly, 2025).

- **Tenant Organization Requirement:** Tenants must form a tenant organization; they may partner with a nonprofit, community land trust, or other entity to submit an offer (New York State Assembly, 2025).

- **Offer Matching:** After the owner receives a third-party offer, tenants have a specified period to match it or assign matching rights to a nonprofit partner (New York State Assembly, 2025).

- **State Funding:** Advocates have sought $250 million in state appropriation for TOPA acquisitions and technical assistance to tenants and nonprofits, though such funding is not strictly required by statute (New York State Assembly, 2025).

- **Permanent Affordability:** S.401 TOPA acquisitions must be kept "permanently affordable," with limits on rent increases and resale prices; mechanisms parallel TCAP's affordability covenant approach and represent a policy alignment opportunity (New York State Assembly, 2025).

**TCAP-S.401 Integration:**
Once S.401 passes, TCAP cooperatives will automatically qualify as eligible "permanently affordable" housing vehicles under state TOPA rules. TCAP's explicit 30-year affordability covenant and equity-building structure will be recognized in state implementing regulations as meeting or exceeding permanent affordability standards, enabling seamless integration of state and local purchase protections (New York State Senate, 2025; New York State Assembly, 2025).

## 5.2 TCAP Core Statutory Codification: Local Law A

### 5.2.1 Title, Purpose, and Definitions

**Proposed Local Law A: Public Equity Transfer Framework for Affordable Housing**

**Enacting Clause:**
"BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL as follows: That the Administrative Code of the City of New York is amended by adding a new Chapter 18 of Title 26 to read as follows:"

**Purpose Statement (§ 26-1801):**

"The purpose of this chapter is to:

(a) Establish a permanent program to convert rental housing subsidies into member equity and democratic control through limited-equity cooperative ownership;

(b) Create pathways for extremely low-income households (at or below 50% of Area Median Income) to accumulate wealth and achieve housing stability;

(c) Preserve permanently affordable housing and prevent displacement by placing buildings under democratic resident control;

(d) Close the racial wealth gap in housing by directing equity benefits to Black, Latino, and other communities of color disproportionately affected by displacement and housing insecurity;

(e) Integrate subsidy-to-equity conversion with NYC's Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902-A) and New York State's Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (S.401) to create a comprehensive acquisition and ownership pathway for resident-controlled housing."

**Definitions (§ 26-1802):**

- **"TCAP Cooperative"** or **"Tenant-Controlled Equity Cooperative"**: A limited-equity housing cooperative, organized under New York Cooperative Law § 1801–2000, that has adopted TCAP affordability covenants and equity-account structures and is designated by HPD as meeting TCAP program standards.

- **"Member"**: An individual shareholder in a TCAP cooperative who has completed member certification and income verification and holds an equity account within the cooperative.

- **"Qualified Entity"**: A nonprofit organization, community land trust, or member-controlled cooperative designated by HPD as meeting criteria for acquiring property under Intro 902 COPA and converting it to TCAP cooperative ownership within a defined timeframe (typically 24–36 months post-closing).

- **"Equity Account"**: An individual member's ownership stake in the cooperative, funded by subsidy redirection (20% of monthly housing subsidy), the member's share of mortgage principal paydown, and any initial down-payment contribution; equity is non-forfeitable and inheritable.

- **"Carrying Charge"**: The member's monthly housing payment in a TCAP cooperative, including rent/occupancy fees, operating costs, and debt service; capped at 15% of the member's verified household income per § 26-1804.

- **"TCAP Affordability Covenant"**: A 30-year deed restriction, recorded on the property, requiring that all units remain permanently affordable to households at or below specified income limits, carrying charges do not exceed 15% of member household income, member resale rights are governed by an affordability-preserving formula, and no unit may be converted to market rate without HPD and City Council approval.

- **"Area Median Income" (AMI)**: As calculated annually by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the New York City metropolitan area, adjusted for family size; 50% AMI is the primary target for member eligibility.

- **"HPD"**: New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

- **"DSS"**: New York City Department of Social Services, including the Human Resources Administration (HRA) and CityFHEPS administration.

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.2.2 Subsidy Conversion and Member Equity Mandates (§§ 26-1803 to 26-1806)

**Subsidy Allocation (§ 26-1803):**

"When any housing subsidy, including but not limited to subsidies under the CityFHEPS (Housing Choice Voucher) program or equivalent rental assistance programs administered by DSS, is assigned or allocated to a TCAP cooperative, DSS and HPD shall ensure that:

(a) **Minimum Equity Allocation**: At least 20% of the monthly subsidy amount shall be credited directly to individual member equity accounts monthly. As of the enactment of this chapter, for a subsidy of $1,800/month, this mandate establishes a minimum of $360/month ($4,320/year) in member equity credits.

(b) **Carrying Charge Coverage**: At least 50% and not more than 70% of the monthly subsidy shall be applied to the cooperative's carrying charge (building operating costs, debt service, maintenance, administration).

(c) **Reserve Requirement**: The remainder (10–30%) may be retained by the cooperative as a capital reserve, subject to periodic audit and member approval of reserve targets.

(d) **Inflation Indexing**: The total subsidy amount shall be adjusted annually, effective April 1 of each year, using the percentage change in the New York City Rent Guidelines Board's Preferred Index of Operating Costs (PIOC), or if PIOC is discontinued, the Consumer Price Index for the New York City metropolitan area, to ensure adequacy of carrying charge coverage and maintenance of the 15% member affordability cap."

**Member Affordability Cap (§ 26-1804):**

"(a) **15% Income Cap**: No TCAP member shall be required to pay a carrying charge exceeding 15% of their verified household income in any month. This affordability cap is enforceable, non-waivable, and shall be maintained in perpetuity or for so long as the member remains a cooperative shareholder.

(b) **Income Growth Exception**: If a member's income grows to exceed 80% of Area Median Income, the member's carrying charge may increase to not more than 20% of income, provided that HPD and DSS jointly determine that such increase does not undermine the member's ability to maintain equity account accumulation.

(c) **Hardship Accommodation**: Members facing temporary income loss or hardship may request a subsidy adjustment or short-term carrying charge reduction, to be reviewed by the cooperative board and HPD; any approved reduction shall not forfeit or reduce the member's equity credits.

(d) **Enforcement**: HPD shall monitor member carrying charges annually; any cooperative charging above the 15% cap shall be subject to compliance order per § 26-1808."

**Member Equity Account Structure (§ 26-1805):**

"(a) **Establishment**: Upon member certification and admission to a TCAP cooperative, each member shall have an individual equity account established and registered with the cooperative and HPD, showing opening balance and monthly accretion.

(b) **Funding Sources**:

- (1) Subsidy redirection: 20% of monthly housing subsidy (minimum $360/month for a $1,800 subsidy).
- (2) Principal paydown: Member's pro-rata share of cooperative mortgage principal paid down monthly.
- (3) Initial contribution: Member's down-payment contribution at entry, typically $8,000 per member, funded via savings match and subsidy advance.

(c) **Ownership**: The equity account is the property of the individual member. The cooperative holds it in trust and may not pledge it to secure cooperative debt.

(d) **Non-Forfeiture**: Equity shall not be forfeited upon member's departure, voluntary withdrawal, or death; member or heir shall receive equity upon exit or by inheritance.

(e) **Quarterly Reporting**: Cooperatives shall provide quarterly equity statements to each member showing opening balance, monthly credits, current balance, and year-end projected balance; information shall be provided in English and other languages spoken by 10%+ of members.

(f) **Annual Verification**: HPD shall verify equity accounting annually through independent audit."

**Use and Disposition of Member Equity (§ 26-1806):**

"(a) **Exit and Resale**: If a member voluntarily leaves the cooperative or sells their share, the member shall receive their accumulated equity either as (i) a lump-sum payment from the cooperative's reserve or refinancing, (ii) a share of any building sale proceeds above the mortgage balance (pro-rata among all members), or (iii) by inheritance to a designated heir who assumes membership.

(b) **Refinancing Distributions**: If the cooperative refinances its mortgage at a lower interest rate, members may receive a pro-rata distribution of interest savings, subject to board approval and retention of minimum capital reserves.

(c) **Prohibitions**: Member equity may not be seized to satisfy cooperative debt or assessments; creditors cannot attach member equity; member equity is exempt from execution and levy by third-party creditors of the member, to the extent permitted by law.

(d) **Exemption from Means-Tested Benefits**: Member equity shall be exempt from asset calculations for SNAP, Medicaid, subsidized childcare, and other means-tested programs, up to a cap established by HPD.

(e) **Transferability**: Member equity may be inherited by a designated family member who agrees to assume membership; the heir's carrying charge shall comply with the 15% affordability cap based on the heir's verified income."

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.2.3 Affordability Covenant and Duration (§§ 26-1807 to 26-1809)

**TCAP Affordability Covenant (§ 26-1807):**

"(a) **Recordation and Binding Effect**: Every TCAP cooperative property shall have a TCAP Affordability Covenant recorded as a deed restriction on the property, running with the land in perpetuity or for a minimum of 30 years, binding current and future cooperative members, boards, and any successor entity.

(b) **Covenant Terms**: The covenant shall provide that:

- (1) All units in the building shall be and remain permanently affordable, serving households at or below 50% of Area Median Income (or, for households initially income-eligible at entry, at adjusted affordability levels for households earning up to 80% AMI).
- (2) Carrying charges shall not exceed 15% of member household income, indexed annually.
- (3) Member resale rights shall be governed by an HPD-approved formula limiting member sales to formula prices (typically 90–110% of original member purchase price adjusted for inflation), preventing speculation while allowing moderate appreciation.
- (4) No unit may be converted to market-rate occupancy, sold to a non-member, or removed from affordability without HPD and City Council approval.
- (5) Democratic governance structures (member assembly voting, board representation, annual meetings) shall be maintained in perpetuity.

(c) **Subordination**: The TCAP affordability covenant shall be senior to all mortgages and liens, with lenders explicitly acknowledging the covenant in mortgage documents and appraisals."

**Covenant Enforcement (§ 26-1808):**

"(a) **Enforcement Authority**: HPD, the NYC Law Department, and members of the cooperative shall have authority to enforce TCAP affordability covenants through:

- (1) Civil injunction preventing covenant violation.
- (2) Specific performance compelling compliance with affordability terms.
- (3) Damages for breach, including refund of excess charges to members.

(b) **Member Standing**: Members shall be recognized as third-party beneficiaries of affordability covenants, with standing to sue for enforcement individually or as a class.

(c) **Right to Cure**: Before seeking injunctive or other equitable relief, HPD shall provide the cooperative 30 days' written notice to cure identified violations; only if cure is not achieved shall enforcement action proceed.

(d) **Remedies**: Violation remedies include:

- (1) Refund of carrying charges in excess of 15% cap, with interest from date of excess payment.
- (2) Restoration of improperly reduced equity accounts.
- (3) Mandatory HPD-approved governance restructuring if board mismanagement is the cause.
- (4) Receiver appointment (last resort) for cases of insolvency or pervasive covenant breach."

**Recordation and Duration (§ 26-1809):**

"(a) **Recording Requirements**: The TCAP affordability covenant shall be recorded in the county where the property is located within 30 days of cooperative formation or building acquisition, and shall identify property address, covenant terms and restrictions, term (30 years minimum with automatic renewal or perpetual language), and enforcement parties.

(b) **Renewal**: At the end of 30 years, if the covenant is set to expire, HPD and the cooperative shall jointly renew it for an additional 30-year term or declare it perpetual, subject to City Council approval if perpetual status requires legislative action.

(c) **Subordination Agreements**: All lenders, title companies, and insurers shall acknowledge the covenant in all documents."

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.2.4 Member Rights and Protections (§ 26-1810 to 26-1812)

**Membership Rights (§ 26-1810):**

"(a) **Right to Occupy**: Each member has an exclusive, non-revocable right to occupy their cooperative unit for the duration of their membership, subject only to payment of carrying charges (capped at 15% of income) and compliance with cooperative rules and lease terms.

(b) **Eviction Protections**: Members may not be evicted except through formal cooperative eviction proceedings on grounds of:

- (1) Non-payment of carrying charge (after 60-day notice and cure opportunity).
- (2) Material lease violation (after 30-day notice and cure opportunity).
- (3) Serious non-compliance with cooperative governance decisions or building rules (after written notice and opportunity to be heard before the board).

(c) **Voting Rights**: Each member-shareholder shall have one vote per membership share (typically one share per unit) in cooperative decisions, including annual board election, budget approval, carrying charge adjustment, major repairs, bylaw amendments (typically requiring two-thirds supermajority), and dissolution (typically requiring 75–80% supermajority).

(d) **Information Rights**: Members may inspect cooperative financial records, member lists, board minutes, and building inspection reports at reasonable hours; information shall be provided in English and other languages spoken by 10%+ of members.

(e) **Participation Rights**: Members shall participate in board committees, training sessions, and governance decisions; the cooperative shall facilitate meaningful participation through flexible scheduling, language access, and childcare support."

**Anti-Retaliation Protections (§ 26-1811):**

"(a) **Prohibited Retaliation**: A cooperative, its board, or any officer shall not retaliate against a member for:

- (1) Asserting or enforcing member rights under this chapter or cooperative bylaws.
- (2) Requesting carrying charge reduction for hardship.
- (3) Reporting building code violations to DOB, Department of Health, or HPD.
- (4) Voting in board elections or advocating for board changes.
- (5) Requesting financial information or transparency.
- (6) Organizing members for governance changes or advocacy.
- (7) Filing a complaint with HPD, the Commission on Human Rights, or other agency.

(b) **Presumption of Retaliation**: If a member is evicted, assessed a special charge, or subject to other adverse action within 90 days of asserting a protected right, a rebuttable presumption of retaliation arises; the cooperative must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action was unrelated to the protected conduct.

(c) **Remedies**: A member subjected to retaliation shall be entitled to reversal of the adverse action, actual damages (including lost carrying charge credits and legal fees), attorney's fees and court costs, and punitive damages if retaliation was willful."

**Non-Discrimination (§ 26-1812):**

"(a) **Applicability**: TCAP cooperatives shall comply with all applicable fair housing laws, including the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3604), NYC Human Rights Law (NYCC § 8-102 et seq.), and related state and local protections.

(b) **Admissions**: Member admissions shall be based solely on income eligibility, credit history, and genuine cooperative capacity to serve; no member shall be denied admission based on race, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, familial status, lawful income source, immigration status, or source of income (including housing vouchers).

(c) **Source-of-Income Protection**: Cooperatives shall not discriminate based on CityFHEPS or other subsidy being the member's primary income source; subsidy income shall be counted as regular income for qualification purposes.

(d) **Board Diversity**: Cooperative bylaws shall encourage diverse board representation reflecting member demographics; boards shall not be composed in a manner that excludes or underrepresents protected groups.

(e) **Complaint Procedures**: Cooperatives shall establish procedures for members to file discrimination complaints; complaints shall be investigated and resolved within 30 days or referred to HPD and the NYC Commission on Human Rights.

(f) **Monitoring and Enforcement**: HPD shall monitor member admissions, board composition, and complaint resolution annually to identify patterns of discrimination; findings shall be reported to the City Council and used to inform compliance enforcement."

______________________________________________________________________

## 5.3 Federal and State Funding Alignment

### 5.3.1 HUD Moving to Work (MTW) Waiver Strategy

**MTW Program Leveraging:**(Gramlich, 2025; HUD Exchange, 2020)

"HPD and NYC may seek designation as a MTW expansion agency (or coordinate with New York City Housing Authority \[NYCHA\] if NYCHA is designated as an MTW agency) to obtain flexibility in deploying federal housing subsidies, including:

(a) **Subsidy Fungibility**: Using freed-up subsidy dollars (via reduced-cost public housing or voucher operations) to fund TCAP cooperative acquisitions and member equity contributions (Gramlich, 2025).

(b) **Flexible Payment Standards**: Setting payment standards (subsidy caps) for CityFHEPS in TCAP cooperatives based on cooperative carrying-charge needs rather than market rents, ensuring adequacy of the 80/20 subsidy split (HUD Exchange, 2020).

(c) **Categorical Eligibility**: Designating TCAP cooperative membership itself as a form of housing assistance eligible for MTW flexibility, streamlining subsidy application and recertification (Gramlich, 2025).

(d) **Direct-to-Cooperative Payments**: Structuring subsidy payments to flow directly to the cooperative's account (rather than to individual members) for processing per the 80/20 equity split (HUD Exchange, 2020).

**MTW Statutory Authority**: 42 U.S.C. § 1437c(c)–(e); 24 CFR Part 990."

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.3.2 Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME Funds

**CDBG Application:**

"NYC shall utilize Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding (received annually from HUD per 42 U.S.C. § 5301 et seq.) to support TCAP:

(a) **Eligible Activities**: CDBG may fund acquisition of real property, rehabilitation and capital improvements, technical assistance and member training, and administrative costs of HPD TCAP operations.

(b) **Low/Moderate-Income Benefit**: TCAP activities shall satisfy CDBG's national objective (70% of funds must benefit low- and moderate-income persons) by targeting membership to households below 50% AMI.

(c) **Coordination with Consolidated Plan**: The annual Consolidated Plan submission to HUD shall explicitly identify TCAP as a CDBG activity, with funding allocation and anticipated outcomes."

**HOME Program Integration:**

"NYC's HOME Program allocation (administered by HPD per 42 U.S.C. § 12701 et seq.) shall prioritize TCAP:

(a) **Eligible Uses**: HOME may fund member down-payment assistance, acquisition financing (gap financing if purchase price exceeds available capital), and pre-acquisition technical assistance.

(b) **HOME Affordability Periods**: HOME-funded projects must maintain affordability for specified periods (15 years for rental, 5 years for ownership). TCAP's 30-year affordability covenant exceeds HOME's minimum and qualifies.

(c) **Match Requirements**: NYC must match HOME funds at 25% (cash or in-kind); TCAP matches shall include in-kind support from HPD staff, NYCHA resident outreach, and donated professional services."

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.3.3 Federal Housing Opportunities through Modernization Act (HOTMA) Alignment

**HOTMA Provisions and TCAP Fit:**(Housing and Urban Development, 2016)

"The Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act (HOTMA, 42 U.S.C. § 1437 et seq., enacted 2016) provides flexibilities in subsidy administration that align with TCAP:

(a) **Subsidy Portability**: HOTMA allows tenants to maintain subsidy portability across jurisdictions and program types; TCAP cooperatives shall honor portability rights for members moving between cooperatives or to rental assistance (Housing and Urban Development, 2016).

(b) **Flexibility in Verification**: HOTMA allows agencies to use self-attestation and categorical eligibility for certain income verifications; HPD and DSS may adopt these to streamline TCAP member recertification.

(c) **Payment Standards Flexibility**: HOTMA grants PHAs flexibility in setting payment standards; NYC may set cooperative-specific standards reflecting carrying-charge costs rather than market comparables.

(d) **Hardship Provisions**: HOTMA mandates hardship exemptions for member rent burden; TCAP cooperatives shall honor member requests for temporary subsidy adjustments or carrying-charge reductions during income loss or emergencies."

______________________________________________________________________

### 5.3.4 New York State Funding Mechanisms

**State Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (SLIHC):**

"TCAP cooperatives may be financed using New York State's Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (SLIHC) program, which provides state tax credits (dollar-for-dollar reduction in NYS taxes) to investors in qualified affordable housing. SLIHC serves households up to 90% AMI (more flexible than federal LIHTC's 60% AMI cap) and recognizes cooperatives as eligible housing types. HPD shall coordinate with NY Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) to allocate SLIHC to TCAP projects."

**State Affordable Housing Funds:**

"NYS Homes for All program and related state funding initiatives shall recognize TCAP as an eligible use. The state's support for tenant organizing and cooperative development shall be coordinated with TCAP, avoiding duplication and ensuring complementary funding."

______________________________________________________________________

## 5.4 Interagency Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)

### 5.4.1 HPD-DSS Subsidy Conversion MOU (Template)

**MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING**
**Between New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and Department of Social Services**
**Regarding TCAP Subsidy Allocation and Member Equity Conversion**

**Purpose**: To establish procedures for allocating CityFHEPS and other housing subsidies to TCAP cooperatives and redirecting 20% of such subsidies into member equity accounts per Local Law A.

**Key Terms:**

1. **Subsidy Eligibility**: DSS shall continue to issue CityFHEPS (Housing Choice Vouchers) or equivalent rental assistance to TCAP members at the standard rate.

1. **80/20 Allocation**: HPD shall instruct DSS to allocate subsidy payments to cooperatives with 80% directed to operating account and 20% to individual member equity accounts.

1. **Annual Indexing**: HPD and DSS shall jointly determine whether the subsidy rate should be adjusted annually to maintain carrying-charge adequacy and the 15% member affordability cap.

1. **Income Verification**: DSS shall conduct annual income verifications using its Asset Verification System (AVS); results shall be shared with HPD and the cooperative.

1. **Recertification Timing**: TCAP member recertifications shall be coordinated with cooperative membership anniversaries.

1. **Member Support**: DSS shall provide accessible income verification and application support; language access and digital access accommodations shall be available.
