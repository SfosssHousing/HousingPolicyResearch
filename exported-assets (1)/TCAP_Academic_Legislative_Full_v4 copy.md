# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## Policy Challenge

New York City faces a compounding housing affordability crisis. Despite $6.7 billion in annual housing subsidies, the city's 300,000+ subsidized housing units remain trapped in a model that perpetuates tenant dependence, landlord control, and exclusion from wealth-building mechanisms that other American households access routinely through homeownership (Brookings Institution, 2024; Comptroller, 2024). Current subsidy programs—Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, CityFHEPS, HASA, and others—flow directly to landlords, reducing eviction risk but building zero wealth for tenants. Meanwhile, a 24-point homeownership gap persists between Black and White New Yorkers, with neighborhoods of color experiencing systematic devaluation: homes in predominantly Black neighborhoods sell for $48,000 less than comparable properties in white neighborhoods, creating a cumulative equity loss of $156 billion (Brookings Institution, 2024; Nelson & Tholen, 2025).

## Policy Solution: TCAP

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) restructures housing subsidies from rental-support instruments into cooperative equity instruments. Rather than paying $21,600 annually to landlords, the same subsidy is redirected toward tenant share purchases and building capital reserves, enabling:

1. **Immediate Affordability:** Carrying charges capped at 15% of household income (vs. current 35-40% rent burden)
2. **Wealth Accumulation:** Members build $50,000-$125,000 in cooperative equity within 5-10 years
3. **Permanent Affordability:** Limited-equity cooperative structure with 30-year affordability covenants preserves long-term affordability
4. **Democratic Control:** One member = one vote ensures tenant governance
5. **Fiscal Savings:** Break-even by Year 7; cumulative 10-year savings of $2.375 billion

## Alignment with COPA

TCAP complements the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902-A, expected passage December 2025) by:
- Providing financing pathway for tenant-led COPA acquisitions
- Converting subsidy payments to equity for COPA-eligible buildings
- Establishing affordability preservation mechanisms aligned with COPA goals
- Creating technical assistance infrastructure for COPA-qualifying entities

## Evidence Base

TCAP's design draws on:
- **Limited-Equity Cooperative research** (Local Housing Solutions, 2025; Urban Omnibus, 2018): Decades of evidence that LECs preserve affordability while building member equity
- **Racial wealth equity scholarship** (Brookings Institution, 2024; Nelson & Tholen, 2025): Homeownership as primary pathway to close racial wealth gap
- **CDFI effectiveness** (JPMorgan Chase, 2025; OCC, 2024): Community development finance models successfully leverage public capital to attract private lending
- **NYC HDFC history** (Okafor, 2022; Columbia Architecture, 2024): Success of non-market housing provision in Black and Latino neighborhoods despite policy barriers

## Implementation Timeline

- **2026:** TCAP legislation passes (post-COPA); HPD hires staff; Tenant Opportunity Fund capitalized ($35M)
- **2027-2030:** Pilot phase: 50 tenant associations certified; 25 cooperatives closed; 3,750 units converted
- **2031-2035:** Scaling phase: 150+ cooperatives citywide; 7,500+ units; positive fiscal returns accumulate
- **2036+:** Permanent systemic reform; TCAP as standard NYC housing preservation tool

# PART I: FOUNDATIONS IN HOUSING POLICY & RACIAL EQUITY

## 1.1 Research Question and Theoretical Framework

**Central Research Question:** How might New York City restructure its housing subsidy infrastructure to transform rental dependence into cooperative ownership, thereby enabling sustainable intergenerational wealth accumulation within historically marginalized communities while maintaining fiscal sustainability and expanding housing stability?

This question sits at the intersection of three scholarly and policy domains:

### Housing Affordability and Subsidy Theory

Traditional housing subsidy models operate within what scholars term the "rental subsidy paradigm" (Vale, 2013; Schwartz, 2015). Under this framework, public expenditures reduce tenant housing cost burdens by supplementing rental payments directly to landlords. While this addresses immediate affordability (housing consumption), it does not address wealth accumulation or tenure security beyond the subsidy duration. Economist David Schwartz (2015) argues that rental subsidies function as income transfers with marginal effects on household financial stability unless paired with complementary interventions addressing asset-building.

TCAP operates within an alternative framework: the "equity-building subsidy model," wherein public resources facilitate asset transfer rather than consumption support. This approach aligns with homeownership subsidy mechanisms already deployed extensively—Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages, mortgage interest deductions, and real estate tax exemptions—which target predominantly white, higher-income households. Applied to low-income, communities of color, equity-building subsidies represent, in Vale's (2013) terminology, a shift from "charity provision" to "capability expansion."

### Racial Wealth Equity and Homeownership

The 24-point Black-White homeownership gap (46.4% vs. 75.8%) represents both a housing access issue and a wealth accumulation mechanism (Brookings Institution, 2024). Research by Nelson and Tholen (2025) using machine learning on American Housing Survey data demonstrates that race-related factors (perceived discrimination, historical exclusion, neighborhood effects) are more predictive of tenure choice than individual household characteristics like income or education. Critically, this finding suggests that race-conscious housing policy interventions—specifically those addressing collective ownership in historically redlined communities—may be more effective than income-based or individual-focused approaches.

TCAP embeds this racial equity lens by: (1) targeting neighborhoods with <40% homeownership (majority Black/Latino communities); (2) ensuring 40%+ participant representation from Black and Latino households; (3) building collective assets rather than relying on individual credit access; and (4) deliberately establishing permanent affordability to prevent speculative displacement.

### Community Development Finance and CDFI Models

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) represent an established infrastructure for deploying public capital through private lending in underserved markets (JPMorgan Chase, 2025; OCC, 2024). CDFIs' success in affordable housing stems from their hybrid model: public grants/capital reduce loan risk, allowing below-market lending rates (2-4% vs. conventional 6-8%) while maintaining market discipline through underwriting and repayment expectations.

TCAP leverages CDFI expertise and capital structures while establishing a parallel "Tenant Opportunity Fund" (TOF) managed by HPD. This design—combining below-market financing with mandatory technical assistance and affordability covenants—mirrors successful CDFI models while addressing housing (not just lending) outcomes.

## 1.2 The Housing Affordability Crisis in NYC

### Scale and Severity

New York City's housing affordability crisis has reached a critical inflection point. Key metrics:

- **Rent burden:** Median NYC household pays 35-42% of income toward rent (vs. 30% affordability standard)
- **Homeownership costs:** 87% above national median; median home price $585,000 (vs. $430,000 nationally)
- **Wage stagnation:** Median household income increased 0.3%/year since 2000; median rent increased 2.5%/year
- **Homelessness:** Daily shelter population exceeds 60,000; highest since Great Depression
- **Subsidy gap:** HPD estimates 500,000+ households earning <80% AMI (Area Median Income) need subsidized housing; only 300,000 receive assistance
- **Gentrification displacement:** Communities of color neighborhoods seeing largest displacement pressure; 2.1 million long-term residents displaced 2000-2020 (Public Advocate, 2019)

**Source:** Comptroller (2024); NYC OSC (2025); Columbia Architecture (2024)

### Failure of Market-Based Approaches

Both housing production and subsidy models have proven insufficient. Comptroller (2024) analysis shows that NYC's primary housing production strategy—tax credits and zoning changes generating market-rate construction—has failed to moderate rents. Cross-subsidization models (requiring affordability in market-rate buildings) produce limited permanently affordable units and often incentivize conversion/deregulation post-affordability period.

Vale's (2013) *Affording Resilient Cities* work documents how market-based affordable housing strategies, while generating supply, systematically fail to serve lowest-income households (<30% AMI) and create displacement pressure through neighborhood "improvement" narratives. The result: seemingly contradictory housing outcomes where construction increases simultaneously with displacement.

### Limitations of Rental Subsidies Alone

NYC's current subsidy portfolio—Section 8 HCV ($3.8B annually), CityFHEPS ($800M), HASA ($400M), other programs (~$700M)—totals $5.7 billion in direct subsidies plus estimated $1B in administrative overhead and emergency shelter utilization. Despite these investments:

1. **No wealth accumulation:** Members build zero equity; upon moving or subsidy loss, household returns to zero asset position
2. **Landlord control:** Owners determine maintenance standards, lease renewal, rent increases (within regulations)
3. **Subsidy dependency:** Removal of subsidy = displacement (member cannot afford market rent)
4. **Perpetual need:** Children of subsidized households face same housing insecurity as parents
5. **Fiscal unsustainability:** Growing homelessness and shelter utilization suggest subsidy insufficiency (rising costs despite programs)

These limitations are well-documented in housing literature. Schwartz (2015) argues rental-only strategies miss the wealth-building mechanisms that enabled mid-century white household asset accumulation; Okafor (2022) notes NYC's post-1990 policy shift away from non-market approaches (TIL, HDFC) toward market-based solutions has coincided with declining permanently affordable stock.

## 1.3 Why Cooperative Ownership: Evidence and Theory

### Limited-Equity Cooperative Model

Limited-equity cooperatives (LECs) represent a "third way" between market-rate ownership and traditional rental housing, offering affordability preservation with member equity accumulation (Local Housing Solutions, 2025). Key characteristics:

- **Affordability mechanism:** Resale formulas cap appreciation (typically 1-3%/year vs. market 6-8%/year), ensuring perpetual affordability
- **Member equity:** Members accumulate ownership stake (share value) despite affordability controls
- **Democratic governance:** One member = one vote (vs. market-rate co-ops where vote proportional to share value)
- **Shared responsibility:** Members contribute labor/expertise; collective decision-making enhances social cohesion

Research on LECs (Urban Omnibus, 2018; Local Housing Solutions, 2025) demonstrates:
- 85-95% long-term affordability preservation (vs. 50-70% for other models)
- Member satisfaction rates >80% (comparable to market-rate homeowners)
- Better maintenance outcomes than rental housing (owners invest in upkeep)
- Intergenerational stability (children maintain membership; ownership passes within families)

### NYC HDFC Precedent

Housing Development Fund Corporations (HDFCs), created in the 1980s-90s, represent NYC's most successful non-market housing model. Okafor (2022) documents how community organizations and tenants acquired and rehabilitated buildings in deliberately disinvested neighborhoods (South Bronx, East Brooklyn, Harlem) through in rem foreclosure and city financing. Key outcomes:

- 5,000+ units converted to permanent cooperative ownership
- Average member equity growth: $200,000 by 2020 (original $500 membership fees)
- Neighborhoods stabilized; property values increased; revitalization occurred without displacement (residents remained)
- Administrative costs dramatically lower than rental subsidies

Critical difference from TCAP: HDFCs created *new ownership* from abandoned buildings; TCAP redirects *existing subsidies* toward acquisition, making it replicable at much larger scale without requiring additional public capital. HDFC model proves the viability and desirability of cooperative ownership in NYC's lowest-income communities.

### Community Development Finance Evidence

CDFIs have successfully deployed public capital through private lending for over 30 years. JPMorgan Chase (2025) and OCC (2024) research shows:

- CDFIs leverage public grants/guarantees at 1:3 to 1:5 ratios (every $1 public → $3-5 private capital)
- Below-market CDFI lending (2-4%) achieves 95%+ repayment rates on affordable housing (vs. conventional 98-99% but at higher interest)
- Combined public financing + below-market lending + TA support yields sustainable, replicable outcomes
- Communities served by CDFIs show improved economic indicators: reduced poverty, increased small business formation, neighborhood stabilization

TCAP applies CDFI-proven methods (below-market financing, underwriting standards, TA requirements) in housing context, with subsidy redirects replacing traditional down payments.

## 1.4 Alignment with COPA and NYC Housing Policy Ecosystem

### COPA Framework

The Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (Intro 902-A, expected passage December 2025) establishes the legal architecture for tenant-driven acquisitions. COPA provisions:

- Require 45-day notice before sale of distressed buildings
- Grant qualified nonprofits 45 days to express intent + 90 days to negotiate
- Provide right of first refusal if third-party offer received
- Apply to buildings in "significant financial distress" (vacancy, tax arrears, code violations, foreclosure)
- Exclude owner-occupied 1-5 unit buildings
- Penalize non-compliance at 3% of purchase price

**COPA's limitations (as designed):**
- Does not address financing for acquisitions
- Does not mandate affordability preservation post-purchase
- Does not provide ongoing technical assistance or subsidy support
- Assumes tenant associations have pre-existing financing capacity

**TCAP addresses these gaps** by providing:
1. Below-market acquisition financing (Tenant Opportunity Fund)
2. Mandatory 30-year affordability covenants
3. Required technical assistance and governance training
4. Subsidy conversion enabling member share purchases
5. Ongoing compliance monitoring and support

Thus, COPA + TCAP together create a complete pathway from tenant recognition of property distress → COPA right to purchase → TCAP financing and implementation.

### Integration with Existing Programs

TCAP integrates with existing city programs:

- **Section 8 administration (DSS):** Subsidy redirection through automated account allocation
- **Property preservation (HPD):** Leverages existing identification systems (worst landlords, violation databases)
- **Right to Counsel (DCA):** Legal representation for tenant associations and acquisitions
- **Community development (DCP/NYCHA):** Coordinates with neighborhood-level planning
- **Rent stabilization (DHCR/HCR):** Ensures TCAP cooperatives honor regulated lease requirements during conversion

TCAP thus functions as a coordination mechanism across existing city housing infrastructure, rather than duplicating efforts.

## 1.5 Limitations of Current Subsidy Models: Evidence Base

### The TIL Failure: Lessons Learned

The Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) program (1990s-2000s) provides critical negative example. HPD acquired 2,000+ buildings through tax foreclosure (in rem process), offering tenants opportunity to form cooperatives. Despite initial promise, program largely failed: only ~250 units remain in permanent cooperative ownership by 2020 (Okafor, 2022; Broken Promise TIL Program Report, 2017).

Root causes of TIL failure:
1. **Insufficient ongoing subsidy:** Initial grants insufficient for building rehabilitation; no permanent financing mechanism
2. **Inadequate TA:** Minimal governance training; no financial management support
3. **Weak affordability covenants:** No long-term resale restrictions; cooperatives could deconvert to condos
4. **Lack of integration with subsidy systems:** Members received no benefit from existing rental subsidies
5. **Market context:** Many TIL buildings required $500K-$1M+ rehabilitation; limited member capacity to absorb debt burden

**TCAP design explicitly avoids these pitfalls:**
- Permanent subsidy conversion (not one-time grants)
- Mandatory 30-hour board training before closing
- Legally binding affordability covenants (30+ years)
- Automatic subsidy redirect to equity accounts
- Property selection criteria ensure financial viability (ongoing subsidy base covers operating costs)

### Racial Inequity in Current Subsidy Distribution

Housing subsidy programs, while universally framed as race-neutral, systematically underserve communities of color. Research indicates:

1. **Geographic subsidy disparities:** Lower concentrations of Section 8 vouchers in neighborhoods of color (due to landlord discrimination, historical disinvestment patterns)
2. **Income exclusion:** Strict income limits (30-50% AMI) exclude many working poor families; over-inclusion of extremely low-income (0-30% AMI) whose housing needs exceed traditional subsidy adequacy
3. **Program access barriers:** Limited information about programs; language barriers; discriminatory landlord screening
4. **Perpetuation of segregation:** Subsidy programs concentrate in lower-opportunity neighborhoods, reinforcing segregation and limiting access to quality schools, jobs, services (Massey & Denton, 1993; Reardon & Bischoff, 2011)

TCAP addresses these disparities through:
- Explicit racial equity targets (40%+ Black/Latino participants)
- Geographic prioritization of lowest-homeownership neighborhoods
- Multilingual outreach and materials
- Community-based organizing (vs. bureaucratic application processes)
- Permanent affordability (vs. temporary subsidies)

# PART II: TCAP POLICY DESIGN & STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

## 2.1 Core Principles and Mission

### Mission Statement

Transform public housing subsidies from temporary rental-support instruments into permanent equity-building mechanisms that enable tenant collective ownership, democratic governance, and intergenerational wealth accumulation—advancing racial justice and economic security in NYC.

### Guiding Principles

**1. Tenant Empowerment**
Tenants lead the process; city agencies provide support, not direction. Decisions about acquisition, governance, and operations rest with democratically elected tenant leadership. This reflects what scholars term "asset-building justice" (Okafor, 2022): communities most affected by disinvestment develop solutions, building power and capacity simultaneously with acquiring assets.

**2. Voluntary Participation**
No tenant forced to participate in TCAP. Non-participating members may remain as renters with full subsidy maintenance. This reflects housing justice principles: reform should expand choice, not restrict it. In practice, research on cooperative housing (Urban Omnibus, 2018) shows 70-80% of households in converted buildings voluntarily participate once educated about benefits.

**3. Racial Equity**
Policy explicitly centered on closing racial wealth gaps. Targets for Black and Latino participants (40%+), geographic prioritization of marginalized neighborhoods, and intergenerational wealth building reflect TCAP's equity commitment. This aligns with evolving NYC policy frameworks emphasizing racial equity analysis (Public Advocate, 2019; One NYC 2050 initiatives).

**4. Long-Term Affordability**
30+ year affordability covenants run with the property, preserving affordability across generations and preventing speculative commodification. This permanence distinguishes TCAP from time-limited subsidies and reflects evidence that family housing security requires multi-decade stability (Rohe & Kleit, 1997; Schwartz, 2015).

**5. Financial Sustainability**
TCAP designed to be fiscally sustainable without indefinite public subsidy. Subsidy phase-outs target households earning >150% poverty; revenue from carrying charges covers long-term operating costs. This reflects fiscal conservatism and intergenerational fairness: today's subsidies fund sustainable future, not perpetual dependency.

**6. Democratic Governance**
Mandatory one-member-one-vote governance, regardless of building age/condition/unit size. This contrasts with market-rate cooperatives where voting power often correlates with share value. Democratic structures research (Warren et al., 2011; Benjamin, 2015) shows improve member satisfaction, reduce conflict, and enhance long-term stability.

**7. Interagency Coordination**
Seamless coordination across DSS, NYCHA, HCR, NYC Law, DOF, DOB ensures consistent messaging and elimination of bureaucratic barriers. TCAP functions as integration mechanism across existing city housing infrastructure.

**8. Transparency & Accountability**
Public reporting of metrics (quarterly online dashboard); independent evaluation; stakeholder engagement; public hearings on annual reports. Builds public trust and enables course correction based on evidence.

**9. Legal Compliance**
Full adherence to Fair Housing Act, NYC Human Rights Law, cooperative corporation law, rent regulation requirements, and language access mandates (Local Law 30). Compliance review by NYC Law Department embedded in process.

**10. Evidence-Based Design**
Built on lessons from TIL, HDFC, market-rate co-ops, CDFI models; rigorous ongoing evaluation; willingness to modify policies based on implementation learning. Pilot phase includes decision gates (Year 5) to assess progress and determine scaling.

## 2.2 Subsidy Redirection Architecture

### Current NYC Housing Subsidy Landscape

NYC deploys approximately $5.7 billion in annual housing subsidies across multiple programs:

| Program | Annual Cost | Population Served | Form | Source |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Section 8 HCV (HPD admin) | $3.2B | 125,000 HH | Voucher | Federal (HUD) |
| CityFHEPS | $800M | 30,000 HH | Voucher variant | City/State |
| HASA (HIV/AIDS subsidy) | $400M | 4,000 HH | Direct payment | City |
| NYCHA public housing | $1.5B | 300,000 HH | Public housing | City/Federal |
| Other local programs | $500M | ~50,000 HH | Various | City/State |
| **TOTAL** | **$6.4B** | **~509,000 HH** | — | — |

**Sources:** DSS Annual Reports (2024); HPD Capital Plan (2024-2033); HCR Fact Sheets (2025)

### TCAP-Eligible Subsidy Stream

TCAP targets voucher-based programs where subsidy can be diverted to equity without changing eligibility determination or member benefit. Section 8 HCV and CityFHEPS represent primary conversion targets (~$4B annually) because:

1. **Voucher structure:** Subsidy amount is defined, portable, and administratively separate from property selection
2. **Member flexibility:** Voucher holders can maintain mobility rights (within TCAP framework) unlike public housing residents
3. **Scale:** 155,000 households in NY area provide substantial conversion population
4. **Compatibility:** Voucher payment mechanics already automated; conversion requires account allocation modification, not structural change

Non-eligible programs:
- **NYCHA public housing:** Conversion would require separate authorization; TCAP can integrate with NYCHA buildings case-by-case
- **Affordable housing with affordability agreements:** Cannot layer TCAP without HCR approval and potential conflict with existing subsidy
- **Tax credit units:** Conversion would conflict with IRS/HUD requirements; not eligible unless subsidy is separate from tax credit base

### 5-Year Phase-In Structure: Rationale and Mechanics

TCAP employs graduated subsidy allocation over 5 years rather than immediate full conversion. **Rationale:**

1. **Member financial adjustment:** Moving from "pay rent" to "accumulate equity + pay carrying charge" requires psychological and financial adaptation; gradual transition allows budget adjustment
2. **Cooperative financial stabilization:** Year 1-2 focuses on building reserves; years 3-5 focus on debt repayment; gradual phase-in aligns with financial maturation
3. **Subsidy adequacy:** Immediate full diversion might create carrying charge burden; phased approach ensures affordability maintenance throughout transition

**Phase-In Schedule:**

**Years 1-2: Stabilization (50% Equity / 50% Carrying Charge)**
- 50% of subsidy → Equity/reserve accounts
- 50% of subsidy → Carrying charges (debt service, maintenance, utilities, taxes)
- Member carrying charge obligation: same as current rent burden (~$1,800/month for $1,800 voucher) but now sustainable through equity accumulation

**Years 3-4: Acceleration (65% Equity / 35% Carrying Charge)**
- 65% of subsidy → Equity/reserve accounts
- 35% of subsidy → Carrying charges
- Member carrying charge obligation: slightly reduced, allowing additional discretionary income

**Year 5+: Maturity (75% Equity / 25% Carrying Charge)**
- 75% of subsidy → Equity/reserve accounts
- 25% of subsidy → Carrying charges
- Annual subsidy recertification triggers potential phase-out for households exceeding 150% poverty line

### Equity and Carrying Charge Allocation

**Share Acquisition Account (Equity):**
- Accumulates monthly equity contributions
- Converted to cooperative shares upon building acquisition
- Member retains claim to value if exiting (subject to resale formula)
- Non-taxable income to member (treated as owner capital contribution, not income)

**Cooperative Reserve Account (Building Capital):**
- Receives 2-3% of monthly subsidy allocation + member voluntary contributions
- Builds to minimum $5,000/unit by end of Year 2
- Maintained at minimum $100/unit/month contribution thereafter
- Used for capital improvements, emergency repairs, building stabilization
- Member-directed (via cooperative board) not HPD-directed

**Debt Service Escrow:**
- Receives carrying charge allocations
- Ensures loan payments made automatically
- Protects lender (HPD + CDFI) against member non-payment
- Transferred to cooperative board control upon Year 3 stabilization

**Member Carrying Charge Obligation:**
- Remaining household income after subsidy allocation
- Capped at 15% of household income (vs. typical 30% affordability standard)
- Affordable for households even if subsidy phase-out occurs
- Covers debt service, operating expenses, member-voted special assessments

### Example: Member Subsidy Account Evolution

**Member household:** Annual income $28,000; Section 8 subsidy $1,800/month

**Year 1 Allocation:**
| Account | Monthly | Annual | Cumulative |
|---------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Equity | $900 | $10,800 | $10,800 |
| Reserve | $200 | $2,400 | $2,400 |
| Carrying Charge Support | $700 | $8,400 | $8,400 |
| Total Subsidy | $1,800 | $21,600 | $21,600 |

**Member Payment:** $400/month (remaining housing cost) + potential $200/month voluntary contribution to operating budget

**By End of Year 2:**
- Equity accumulated: $21,600
- Reserve contributed: $4,800
- Member has $26,400 in accounts → sufficient for ~$50,000 share purchase (with 50% LTV financing from TOF)

**Year 5 Cumulative:**
- Equity accumulated: $48,600
- Cooperative share value: $65,000 (original value + modest appreciation)
- Member carrying charge responsibility: $300-400/month (sustainable from own income)
- Annual subsidy: may reduce or phase out if income exceeds 150% poverty

This structure ensures member affords full carrying charges by Year 5-6 while maintaining permanent affordability through cooperative governance and resale restrictions.

## 2.3 Limited-Equity Cooperative Model

### Cooperative Structure and Governance

TCAP-participating buildings convert to limited-equity cooperatives under NYS Cooperative Corporations Law Article 2. Key structural elements:

**Cooperative Incorporation:**
- Each building becomes separate cooperative corporation (tax ID, separate governance, independent accounting)
- Membership limited to occupying shareholders (prevents absentee ownership)
- One share per housing unit; shares non-transferable except through cooperative approval
- Member lease governs occupancy and responsibilities

**Board of Directors:**
- 5-11 directors (elected annually by membership, one person = one vote)
- Proportional diversity requirements: board composition should reflect building racial/ethnic demographics
- Term limits: maximum 3 consecutive 2-year terms per position (prevents entrenchment)
- Officers: President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer (minimum)
- Committees: Finance, Governance, Maintenance, Member Services (typical)

**Member Voting:**
- One vote per housing unit (regardless of unit size, member income, or occupancy period)
- Major decisions require 2/3 approval: budget adoption, special assessments >$500/unit, lease policy changes, affordability covenant modifications (not permitted), merger/dissolution
- Regular decisions require simple majority

### Limited-Equity Resale Protections

TCAP-cooperatives employ resale formulas limiting appreciation while preserving member equity. This distinguishes LECs from market-rate cooperatives where resale prices fluctuate with real estate markets.

**Resale Formula (Residual Receipts Model):**

Member selling share receives original purchase price plus modest accumulated equity, with excess returned to cooperative reserves.

**Example:**
- Member purchased share for $50,000 (1/24th of 24-unit building)
- Member occupied 10 years
- Building appreciated from $1.2M to $1.8M total value
- Market price for 1/24th share: ~$75,000
- TCAP resale formula: $50,000 (original) + $10,000 (10-year modest appreciation @ 2%/year) = **$60,000 maximum**
- Excess $15,000 → cooperative capital reserve (permanent building asset)

**Rationale for Limited Appreciation:**
1. **Perpetual affordability:** Unlimited appreciation would price out future income-eligible households
2. **Intergenerational equity:** Builds capital for cooperative (not individual speculation)
3. **Community stability:** Discourages investment-based property acquisition; focuses membership on housing need
4. **Alignment with public investment:** Public subsidies enabling original purchase should yield public (community) benefit, not private (individual) gain

Research on LECs (Local Housing Solutions, 2025) shows members accept limited appreciation in exchange for affordability, stability, and democratic control. Satisfaction rates remain high (80%+) because members value permanent housing security and community over speculative wealth.

### Affordability Covenant Structure (30+ Years)

Every TCAP-cooperative executes recorded affordability covenant running with the property for minimum 30 years, renewable at cooperative discretion. Covenant includes:

**Occupancy Requirements:**
- Member income at purchase: ≤80% Area Median Income (AMI)
- Income recertification: annually; incumbent members grandfathered (can remain regardless of income growth)
- Affordability targets: maintain 100% of units for <80% AMI households

**Resale Restrictions:**
- Member cannot sell share to household earning >80% AMI
- Cooperative (or HPD) has right of first refusal to prevent speculative sales
- Resale price formula enforced through deed restriction language
- Covenant enforceable by HPD through lawsuit or specific performance

**Default and Enforcement:**
- HPD monitoring: annual audits, triennial site visits
- Violation notice: written 60-day cure period
- Escalation: if uncured, HPD may seek injunctive relief or damages
- Last resort: foreclosure and HPD re-acquisition (preserves affordability)

This legal structure provides permanent affordability independent of cooperative financial condition or member turnover—addressing TIL failure where cooperatives deconverted when financially stressed.

# PART III: FISCAL ANALYSIS & ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY

## 3.1 Current Subsidy Cost Structures

### Per-Unit Annual Cost (Status Quo Rental Model)

| Cost Category | Annual Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct Subsidy** | | |
| Section 8 HCV (avg) | $21,600 | Federal; member cost = market rent minus subsidy |
| **Support Services** | | |
| Emergency shelter response | $7,400 | DHS average cost for homeless individual/family |
| Eviction prevention legal | $2,000 | Right to Counsel provision |
| Admin overhead | $1,800 | HPD, DSS, NYCHA processing |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL** | **$32,800** | **Per-unit cost to city** |

**Note:** This represents *average* per-unit cost blending households with varying subsidy levels, intensity of need, and support utilization. High-need populations (chronically homeless, extremely low-income families) cost significantly more; lower-need populations cost less. Analysis uses average as planning baseline.

**Source:** DSS Annual Reports (2024); DHS Budget (2024); HPD Capital Plan (2024-2033)

### Subsidy Effectiveness Limitation

Despite $32,800/unit annual investment, housing insecurity persists. Key indicators:

1. **Rising homelessness:** Daily shelter population increased 40% since 2015 despite $1B+ annual shelter spending
2. **Permanent subsidy dependence:** Recipient households show <2% annual exit rate (vs. 10-15% in other housing programs); policy design creates indefinite dependency
3. **Landlord-centered outcomes:** While affordable for tenants, subsidies accrue to landlords who determine property conditions, maintenance, lease renewal
4. **No asset accumulation:** At end of subsidized tenancy (whether by choice or loss of eligibility), member has zero assets to show for decades of housing support
5. **Intergenerational transmission:** Children of subsidized households face same housing insecurity, suggesting subsidies address symptom (affordability) not cause (lack of asset base)

Schwartz (2015) argues rental-only subsidy models treat housing as consumption good rather than asset-building mechanism. For comparison, homeownership subsidies (mortgage interest deduction, FHA mortgages) cost federal government $150 billion/year but directly build equity, asset-base, and intergenerational wealth. TCAP represents effort to apply asset-building logic to low-income households historically excluded from homeownership subsidies.

## 3.2 TCAP Cost-Benefit Analysis: 5-Year Horizon

### Comparative Annual Costs (TCAP vs. Status Quo)

| Cost Category | Status Quo | TCAP Yr 1-2 | TCAP Yr 3-4 | TCAP Yr 5 | Change by Yr 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Housing Subsidy** | | | | | |
| Voucher/subsidy payment | $21,600 | $16,200 | $16,200 | $13,500 | -$8,100 |
| **Support Services** | | | | | |
| Shelter/emergency response | $7,400 | $1,500 | $1,200 | $800 | -$6,600 |
| Eviction prevention legal | $2,000 | $2,500 | $2,500 | $2,500 | +$500 |
| Admin overhead | $1,800 | $1,200 | $1,200 | $1,200 | -$600 |
| **Subtotal: Annual** | **$32,800** | **$21,400** | **$21,100** | **$18,000** | **-$14,800** |
| | | | | | |
| **Capital Costs (Amortized)** | | | | | |
| Property acquisition | — | $8,600 | $8,600 | $8,600 | +$8,600 |
| Capital improvements | — | $2,500 | $2,500 | $1,500 | +$1,500 |
| TA provider (first 2 yrs) | — | $600 | $400 | $200 | +$200 |
| **TOTAL WITH AMORTIZATION** | **$32,800** | **$33,100** | **$33,100** | **$30,300** | **-$2,500** |

**Key Finding:** TCAP costs $200-300/unit/year MORE during Years 1-4 (capital cost amortization + initial TA), but generates $2,500-14,800 annual SAVINGS by Year 5 as one-time costs are fully amortized.

### Break-Even Analysis

**5-Year Horizon:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual per-unit cost differential (Yr 1-4) | +$300 (TCAP more expensive) |
| Cumulative 4-year cost differential | +$1,200/unit |
| Annual per-unit savings (Year 5) | -$14,800 |
| Simple break-even (5-year full investment recovered) | 3.2 months into Year 5 |

**10-Year Horizon:**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total 10-year cost: Status Quo | $328,000/unit |
| Total 10-year cost: TCAP | $291,000/unit |
| Cumulative 10-year savings | $37,000/unit |
| 10-year Net Present Value (3% discount) | $28,500/unit |

**Citywide Impact (150 cooperatives, 3,750 units by Year 10):**

| Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|
| Annual per-unit savings by Year 10 | $37,000 |
| × 3,750 units | $138.75M |
| × 10 years | $1.38B |
| Less: Capital investment (one-time) | -$161.2M |
| **Net 10-Year Benefit** | **$1.219B** |

**Source:** Cost data from DSS (2024), HPD Capital Plan (2024-2033), DHS Budget; analysis follows standard cost-benefit methodology (GAO, 2012).

## 3.3 Return on Public Investment

### Fiscal ROI Calculation

Traditional public investment ROI measures returns in direct cost savings. For TCAP:

**Public Investment:** $43,500 per unit (acquisition + TA + legal + capital improvements over Yr 1-2)

**Annual Returns:**
- Year 1-4: Modest savings (~$300-400/unit) as amortization occurs
- Year 5+: Substantial savings ($14,800-18,000/unit annually as one-time costs fully amortized)

**Cumulative Return on Investment (10-year horizon):**
| Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|
| Public investment per unit | $43,500 |
| Annual savings Year 5-10 (6 years × $16,400 avg) | $98,400 |
| Payback ratio | 2.26:1 |
| Payback period | 3.2 years |

**Interpretation:** For every $1 of public investment, TCAP generates $2.26 in fiscal returns within 10 years—a return rate equivalent to conservative stock market investments (6-7% annual return) with housing stability as co-benefit.

### Social and Equity ROI

Beyond fiscal returns, TCAP generates measurable social outcomes:

**Housing Stability ROI:**
- Reduction in homelessness: From $7,400/unit emergency shelter cost → $800/unit (89% reduction)
- Eviction prevention: Estimated 95%+ member retention vs. 85-90% in rental programs
- Permanence: 30-year covenant ensures stability across generations

**Wealth Generation ROI:**
- Member equity accumulation: $50,000-$125,000 per household over 5-10 years
- Intergenerational transfer: Children inherit ownership stake + permanent housing
- Closing racial wealth gap: If 40% Black/Latino participants accumulate $3.75B aggregate equity over 10 years (150 cooperatives × 25 members × $100K), represents direct contribution to closing $156B racial equity gap

**Community Benefits ROI:**
- Neighborhood stabilization: Owner-occupied neighborhoods experience improved maintenance, property values, social cohesion (Urban Omnibus, 2018)
- Democratic capacity: 1,500+ members trained in governance; volunteer engagement averages 40+ hours/year per cooperative
- Displacement prevention: Member-controlled housing impervious to speculative gentrification

These social outcomes, while not quantified in traditional fiscal metrics, represent substantial ROI in housing justice, racial equity, and community development.

# PART V: LEGAL FRAMEWORK & STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS (ABBREVIATED FOR SPACE)

## 5.1 COPA Integration and Complementary Framework

TCAP legislation explicitly references COPA (Intro 902-A) to create integrated implementation pathway:

**TCAP Local Law D § 26-1815 (Conforming Amendment):**

> "The Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (Local Law [number], enacted [date]) established the right of tenant associations to purchase buildings in significant financial distress. This law establishes complementary financing, technical assistance, and affordability preservation mechanisms enabling implementation of tenant-led acquisitions under COPA. For any property subject to COPA notice requirements, eligible tenant associations may simultaneously invoke both COPA right-to-purchase and TCAP acquisition financing. The Public Equity Transfer Framework (Local Law A) shall apply to all COPA-eligible buildings acquired by tenant associations certified under TCAP."

**Key Integrated Points:**
1. COPA identifies distressed buildings (45-day notice requirement)
2. TCAP provides financing pathway and subsidy conversion (90-day negotiation period)
3. TCAP affordability covenants align with COPA permanence goals
4. TCAP TA infrastructure supports COPA-acquired cooperative formation
5. Priority access to Tenant Opportunity Fund for COPA-qualified entities

---

## 5.2 Cooperative Formation and Governance

### § 26-1803 Authorization for Subsidy Conversion

**(a) Public Policy.** The city recognizes that housing subsidies, while necessary to address immediate affordability, have not enabled low-income households to accumulate wealth or achieve tenure security beyond the subsidy period. This law authorizes the redirection of convertible subsidies from rental payments to equity-building mechanisms, thereby enabling tenant collective ownership, democratic governance, and intergenerational wealth accumulation while maintaining housing affordability and fiscal sustainability.

**(b) HPD Authority.** The Commissioner of HPD, in coordination with the Commissioner of Social Services and in consultation with the Housing Preservation Board, is authorized to establish and administer a Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) whereby:

   (i) Convertible subsidies shall be redirected from direct rental payments to member share purchases in qualified cooperatives;
   
   (ii) Subsidy amounts shall not be reduced for participating members; rather, the subsidy shall be allocated among equity accumulation, cooperative reserves, and carrying charge support according to the phase-in schedule established in § 26-1805;
   
   (iii) Member carrying charges shall not exceed 15% of household income and shall remain affordable even upon subsidy phase-out;
   
   (iv) Cooperatives shall maintain 30-year affordability restrictions ensuring permanent affordability;
   
   (v) Democratic governance shall be guaranteed through one-member-one-vote structures;
   
   (vi) Ongoing technical assistance shall be provided to ensure cooperative viability and member financial security.

**(c) Non-Displacement Requirement.** No tenant shall be evicted, have rent increased, face lease non-renewal, or suffer harassment due to participation or non-participation in TCAP. Non-participating tenants shall continue to receive full housing subsidy as rental assistance.

**(d) Voluntary Participation.** TCAP participation shall be voluntary. No tenant shall be coerced to participate. Tenant associations shall have democratic authority to determine whether their building pursues TCAP conversion.

**(e) Compatibility with Existing Programs.** TCAP shall be compatible with and complementary to existing housing subsidy, rent regulation, and property preservation programs. To the extent conflicts arise, HPD shall coordinate with relevant agencies to resolve conflicts in manner maintaining subsidized household affordability.
