---

**Total 10-Year Revenue:** $42,920,000

---

### PART III: NET CITY COST VS. BASELINE

#### BASELINE SCENARIO (No TCAP Program)

Continued use of traditional rental subsidies for affected households:

**Assumptions:**
- Current Section 8 / CityFHEPS budgets continue
- Same 9,000 households at average $18,000/year subsidy
- Baseline annual subsidy cost: $162,000,000
- Baseline 10-year cost (without inflation adjustment): $1,620,000,000

---

#### TCAP SCENARIO

**Program Costs:** $189,300,000 (as calculated above)

**TCAP Household Subsidies:**
- 500 households by end of Year 3
- 1,200 households by end of Year 5
- 2,000 households by end of Year 10
- Average subsidy: $16,200/year (20% conversion to equity)
- Cumulative TCAP subsidy cost (10 years): $98,400,000

**Total TCAP Cost:** $189,300,000 (operations) + $98,400,000 (subsidies) = **$287,700,000**

---

#### FISCAL IMPACT SUMMARY

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| **Baseline (rental subsidy only)** | $1,620,000,000 |
| **TCAP Program Alternative** | $287,700,000 |
| **NET CITY SAVINGS** | **$1,332,300,000** |
| **Return on Investment** | **4.6:1** |

---

### PART IV: NON-FISCAL BENEFITS

#### A. SHELTER SYSTEM COST REDUCTIONS

**Current shelter costs:** $62,000 per family annually

**Assumption:** 15% reduction in shelter utilization among TCAP participants

- Year 1-2: 50 fewer families in shelter = $3.1M savings
- Year 3-5: 150 fewer families in shelter = $9.3M savings
- Year 6-10: 300 fewer families in shelter = $18.6M savings

**Cumulative Shelter Savings (10 years):** $31,000,000

---

#### B. EVICTION PREVENTION COSTS AVOIDED

**Current eviction prevention expenditure:** $15,000 per household

**Assumption:** 60% reduction in eviction risk for TCAP participants

- Year 3-5: 1,200 households × $15,000 × 60% × 0.5 = $5.4M saved
- Year 6-10: 2,000 households × $15,000 × 60% × 0.5 = $9.0M saved

**Cumulative Eviction Prevention Savings:** $14,400,000

---

#### C. HOUSING COURT COST REDUCTIONS

**Current housing court costs:** ~$500/case for city administration

- Eviction filings prevented: 600/year
- Court processing savings: ~$300,000/year
- Cumulative 10-year savings: $2,100,000

---

#### D. INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH ACCUMULATION

**Average equity per household by Year 5:** $18,000
**Average equity per household by Year 10:** $32,000

**Total accumulated wealth for 2,000 households:** $64,000,000

This wealth remains in communities, enabling down payments for home purchase, education, business investment, and emergency reserves.

---

#### E. NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION

**Reduced displacement impacts:**
- School enrollment stability
- Community organizational strength
- Reduced trauma and displacement costs
- Enhanced social cohesion

**Estimated value:** $50,000-100,000 per building per year

For 20 buildings by Year 10: $1,000,000-2,000,000/year

---

### PART V: LONG-TERM FISCAL IMPACTS (YEARS 11-30)

#### SUSTAINED AFFORDABILITY

Beyond 10-year analysis period, TCAP continues to provide:

- Permanent affordability (30+ year covenants)
- Continued wealth building for member households
- Ongoing shelter system cost reductions
- Reduced eviction prevention costs
- Neighborhood stabilization benefits

**Estimated annual benefits in Years 11-30:** $40,000,000+/year

**Cumulative 20-year extended benefit (Years 11-30):** $800,000,000+

---

### PART VI: COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS

| Program Type | Cost per Unit | Affordability Duration | Wealth Building |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Traditional Rental Subsidy** | $18,000/year | While subsidy continues | None |
| **Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)** | $20,000/year | 30 years | Limited |
| **Affordable Housing Development** | $60,000 one-time + $12,000/year | 30-60 years | None |
| **TCAP (Cooperative)** | $15,000/year avg | 30+ years | $32,000/unit |

TCAP offers superior long-term cost-effectiveness while building household wealth.

---

### PART VII: SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

#### Scenario A: Conservative (Lower Participation)

- Reduced participation: 1,000 households by Year 10 (vs. 2,000)
- Loan default rate: 10% (vs. 8%)
- Cooperative failure rate: 15% (vs. 5%)

**Impact:** 10-year net savings: $800,000,000 (vs. $1.3B baseline)
**Still highly cost-effective**

---

#### Scenario B: Optimistic (Higher Participation)

- Increased participation: 3,000 households by Year 10
- Loan performance: 95% repayment, 5% interest
- Strong cooperative outcomes

**Impact:** 10-year net savings: $1.8B
**Substantially greater fiscal benefits**

---

#### Scenario C: Different Subsidy Allocation

- 60% to equity (vs. 75% in baseline)
- Extended carrying charge subsidies

**Impact:** Slightly reduced wealth building but improved affordability sustainability
**10-year cost slightly lower but long-term benefits similar**

---

### PART VIII: BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

| Timeframe | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Year 5** | Program begins generating positive ROI |
| **Year 7** | Cumulative costs fully recovered through savings |
| **Year 10** | Cumulative net benefit: $1.3 billion |
| **Year 20** | Cumulative net benefit: $2.1 billion |
| **Year 30** | Cumulative net benefit: $2.8 billion |

---

### PART IX: RISK FACTORS AND MITIGATION

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Lower than projected participation** | Reduced savings | Community organizing support, accessible application process |
| **Cooperative financial failure** | Loss of invested capital | Strong underwriting, technical assistance, emergency stabilization fund |
| **Higher than expected default rates** | Reduced fund repayment | Conservative underwriting, member education, financial counseling |
| **Policy changes at state/federal level** | Program disruption | Diversified funding sources, local resources invested |
| **Market rate increases** | Affordability pressure** | Long-term covenants, limited-equity resale restrictions |

---

### PART X: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

**Financial Summary:**

1. **TCAP is fiscally responsible**, delivering 4.6:1 return on investment over 10 years
2. **Net city savings of $1.3+ billion** compared to baseline rental subsidy continuation
3. **Program generates $40.3 million in loan repayments**, enabling fund recycling
4. **Additional $47.5 million in shelter system, eviction prevention, and court cost savings**
5. **Long-term benefits extend 30+ years** through permanent affordability preservation
6. **Wealth building of $64 million+ for participating households**

**Recommendation:**

Approve full TCAP implementation with requested appropriations for:
- $5.1 million Year 1 implementation costs
- $40 million initial Tenant Opportunity Fund capitalization
