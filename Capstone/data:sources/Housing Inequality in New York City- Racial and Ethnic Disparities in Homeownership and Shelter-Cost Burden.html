The Forum brings together, with a collaborative, solution-oriented focus, the different entities and sectors involved in expanding affordable housing. The collaboration between HUD and the Forum in recent years is a great example of this solution-focused exchange of information.</p> <p>For the last five years, I have served as the Senior Counsel to the General Counsel at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). From this perspective, I have seen first-hand the progress that the Forum facilitates.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib2" id ="ref2" >2</a> </span> ] At our joint HUD-American Bar Association (ABA) sessions at the annual Forum meetings in the District of Columbia, at our various roundtable lunches, and from your hearty sharing of verbal and written comments submitted on HUD's various guidance, rules, and initiatives, we have learned from each other arid furthered our common cause to improve and increase affordable housing opportunities. Three areas in particular illustrate this collaboration:</p> <p>( <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib1" id ="ref3" >1</a> </span> ) Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)-Federal Housing Administration (FHA) harmonization,</p> <p>( <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib2" id ="ref4" >2</a> </span> ) Previous Participation Regulations, and</p> <p>( <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib3" id ="ref5" >3</a> </span> ) Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD).</p> <span> <h3> <a href="#AN0121811283-3" id="AN0121811283-3">LIHTC-FHA Harmonization</a> </h3> </span> <p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Multifamily program insures mortgage loans to multifamily developments, increasing available credit for new construction, substantial rehabilitation, moderate repairs, or refinancing or modifying existing debt.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib3" id ="ref6" >3</a> </span> ] HUD closed 872 FHA-insured loans, worth over $10.7 billion, in FY 2016.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib4" id ="ref7" >4</a> </span> ] At its peak in 2013, FHA closed over 1,600 loans worth over $16.5 billion. While not all of these developments are low-income, FHA-insured financing can be a powerful tool for urban development, including low-income development.</p> <p>The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is widely recognized as the primary low-income housing production program in the country. According to the National Council of State Housing Agencies (NCSHA), LIHTCs were allocated to almost 1,400 transactions in 2014,[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib5" id ="ref8" >5</a> </span> ] and on average, credits are allocated to about 100,000 units every year.</p> <p>Neither program is without criticism, but it is hard to deny that each is a pretty big fish in the housing pond. In recent years, it has become easier to use FHA-insured financing and LIHTCs together in the same transaction. In FY 2016, over 30 percent of FHA-insured loan transactions used LIHTCs. But it was not always that way. The programs were so notoriously difficult to combine that Congress included a special provision in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) directing HUD to make the programs work better together.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib6" id ="ref9" >6</a> </span> ]</p> <p>There have been a lot of changes in the past eight years that have made the programs more compatible. Some of those changes were driven by policy or business decisions that we lawyers had very little influence on. For example, HUD's Office of Housing did a lot of work internally to analyze its review of applications and streamline procedures wherever possible. In addition, the previous reduction to the FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) undoubtedly has had a strong, positive influence on LIHTC and FHA combination. However, we lawyers -- and in particular, the collaboration brought about through the Forum -- have had a positive influence.</p> <p>We might be bad with numbers, but we are excellent implementers. There are a number of contractual documents and structural components that have allowed the vision of the policy makers to come to fruition. While there are many examples to choose from, two come to mind immediately: structuring cash collateralization of short-term bonds and the LIHTC Rider to the Security Instrument.</p> <p>First, take the structuring of cash collateralization for short-term bonds in FHA transactions, for example. With the various developments in the financial markets in the past decade, cash collateralization for tax-exempt bond sourced construction financing to generate 4 percent LIHTCs has gained popularity. This structure being a novel innovation, it was not familiar to HUD. HUD appropriately reviewed proposals for this structure and analyzed whether the structure raised any statutory, regulatory, or policy issues. Forum members in conference panels and other discussions helped to explain the rationale and benefits for the structuring. These discussions, in turn, helped to identify and address areas of concern for both sides. For example, through these discussions, HUD and the industry clarified that FHA insurance does not attach to the loan until it is disbursed to the borrower, ensuring that the structure complies with FHA requirements.</p> <p>Another example is the Rider to the Security Instrument, a two-page rider to the FHA-required mortgage instrument (form HUD-94000M).[7 ]In simple to understand, not overly legalistic terms, the Rider identifies the LIHTC investor, sets forth an address for courtesy notices, provides for the transfer of equity interests and documents pre-approval for removal of the general partner/managing member and substitution by a special limited partner or special investor member. Of course, the form is not perfect. The procedure for pre-approval of general partner/managing member removal is not perfect. However, being able to identify the needs of both sides and work through a standard process is a huge step forward. The form provides a simple and standardized method to address the most common investor concerns in transactions. In this way, it creates a contractual vehicle to implement the mutual goals of the LIHTC investors and HUD policy makers. The Rider could not have been developed without communication and collaboration between LIHTC stakeholders and HUD. Both sides brought their own perspectives and both sides lacked understanding of the other's interests. Through discussions, roundtable gatherings, compiled comments, and in many other ways, the Forum helped create space for needed discussions that identified the issues and sought solutions.</p> <p>Indeed, the creation of the Rider to the Security Instrument is just one piece of the larger effort to revise and standardize the Multifamily program documents. While it was a much larger effort, not without controversy, and did not focus on LIHTC-FHA harmonization, the effort to standardize the documents and closing procedures did help the coordination of LIHTC and FHA. After HUD finalized the documents in 2011, the dialogue continued during implementation efforts. On several occasions, the General Counsel, myself, and other representatives from the Office of General Counsel participated in roundtable discussions and conference panels relating to the Multifamily documents. Through these various discussion formats, the Forum helped to raise questions and uncover issues that helped HUD develop procedures and standardized approaches to common stumbling blocks. FHA's Multifamily insurance program is stronger because of our dialogue.</p> <span> <h3> <a href="#AN0121811283-4" id="AN0121811283-4">Previous Participation Regulations</a> </h3> </span> <p>On October 14, 2016, HUD published in the Federal Register a final rule revising its "previous participation review" regulations.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib8" id ="ref10" >8</a> </span> ] For certain triggering events relating to programs administered by HUD's Office of Housing, HUD reviews a participant's previous participation in federal programs prior to approving its participation in the subject project. The concept of reviewing previous participation is fairly simple, but a number of factors over the years had contributed to the review process becoming confusing, burdensome, and frustrating for both applicants and HUD reviewers. One of those factors was that HUD's regulations had not been effectively updated in many years. The regulatory text was confusing and both over- and under-inclusive. My favorite example of this over- and under-inclusivity is that although the previously existing regulations specified who must file a previous participation certification under an extensive list of scenarios (and indicate that form number 2530 must be used), they fail to contemplate limited liability companies.</p> <p>When HUD set out to improve the Previous Participation review process, it engaged the industry to identify issues and areas of frustration. Among the areas needing improvement, both internal HUD parties and external stakeholders identified the regulations as needing revision. A previous effort in 2006 had failed to achieve its objectives, but we started from the comments received at that time. HUD published proposed regulations in August 2015. The proposed rule greatly streamlined the regulations and more clearly set forth HUD's objective to review the previous participation of those participants in control of a project. However, the public comments received in response to the proposed rule indicated continued uncertainty and concern with the previous participation review process. The comments indicated that, in attempting to simplify and streamline the previous participation review process, the absence of the over-prescription, a feature of the existing codified process, may have increased uncertainty regarding the requirements and variability in their application. The comments urged HUD to publish additional guidance to provide further clarity and provide greater detail on the requirements contemplated in the proposed regulations. In response, rather than finalizing the rule in early 2016, HUD published a companion processing guide for comment in May 2016. Having now seen more detailed guidance, the ensuing public comments responded to specific features of the processing guide and elements believed to be missing from the guidance. Taking these comments into consideration, HUD finalized and published the revised rule and processing guide in October.</p> <p>The revised previous participation regulations and processing guide are not perfect, but they are a considerable improvement to the process in place prior to October 2016. One of the reasons HUD chose to revise the regulations and to separate out further guidance in the processing guide is to provide the ability to revise the requirements in the processing guide without having to repeat the several years' effort needed to revise the regulations when it becomes clear that a scenario has not been adequately contemplated or industry norms alter considerations of certain scenarios: in brief, to provide needed flexibility to both HUD and applicants seeking to participate in HUD's multifamily and/or healthcare programs. Also, the revised regulations cannot address all of the concerns relating to the previous participation review process; for example, the regulations and guidance must be implemented consistently and everyone would like an updated platform for the electronic system. Again, while not perfect, the revised regulations and processing guide are a few big steps in the right direction.</p> <p>The Forum and Forum members played a valuable role in the creation of this guidance. The Forum organized roundtable discussions on the topic. At the Forum's annual meeting in D.C., the Forum organized panel discussions in which both Forum members and HUD representatives participated, discussions in which longstanding concerns about the previous participation process were raised. Perhaps most valuably, the Forum submitted compiled comments to articulate members' concerns. As with all comments received, HUD carefully considered the comments submitted and used them to inform its revisions to the rule and processing guide. Now that the rule is published, the Forum's network has publicized the publication and has offered to help in industry training. This collaboration helps HUD protect the public interest in a way that preserves the accessibility and usefulness of HUD's programs.</p> <span> <h3> <a href="#AN0121811283-5" id="AN0121811283-5">RAD</a> </h3> </span> <p>HUD received limited authority to implement the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) in HUD's 2012 Appropriations Act.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib9" id ="ref11" >9</a> </span> ] Because of decades' worth of chronic underfunding to the public housing program, our country's public housing faces a capital needs backlog of over $25 billion. This backlog resul ts in a net loss of 10,000 to 15,000 public housing units each year. RAD seeks to stabilize public housing projects by converting their assistance to Section 8 rental assistance and facilitating, where appropriate, the leveraging of rental subsidy for additional capital. RAD comes with $0. RAD provides $0 extra for construction funding or to boost rents or to provide much needed reserves. Yet, to date, RAD has leveraged over $3 billion in hard construction financing. About 50,000 units have converted. Transactions are in development for all 185,000 units of the authority cap.</p> <p>RAD is not perfect. In many ways, HUD's RAD team is building the airplane as we fly it. But, oh man, has it improved in the last three years! Since the first deals started to close in 2013, we have made significant improvements to RAD policies and procedures.</p> <p>Improvements to RAD have been driven by many factors. Without limitation, these include experience, internal HUD pressures, and Congress. One very important contributor to our progress has been industry input. While there are many examples of the Forum's involvement leading to positive change that I could point to, I will highlight two: the development of the Lender and LIHTC riders and the 2016 revisions to the form documents.</p> <p>The Lender and LIHTC riders have been very important in helping RAD reach its goals. It is one thing to say in theory that RAD allows for the collateralization of the project or the HAP contract and encourages this leveraging to bring in private capital. It is another thing to structure the program in a way to allow for the lenders to have a foreclosure remedy while upholding RAD's statutory requirements.</p> <p>The RAD statute states,</p> <p>the Secretary shall require ownership or control of assisted units by a public or nonprofit entity except as determined by the Secretary to be necessary pursuant to foreclosure, bankruptcy, or termination and transfer of assistance for material violations or substantial default, in which case the priority for ownership or control shall be provided to a capable public entity, then a capable entity, as determined by the Secretary [ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib10" id ="ref12" >10</a> </span> ]</p> <p>How do you provide for foreclosure or transfer by deed in lieu of foreclosure while upholding the statutory mandate to provide a "priority for ownership or control" in "a capable public entity, then a capable entity"? Do you insert HUD into each state's foreclosure process? Do you prohibit foreclosure unless a right of first refusal is given to a public body? What happens if a public body is willing to take over the project for free but not pay off any of the outstanding debt?</p> <p>Similar questions arise from the LIHTC investor's perspective. The LIHTC investor wants to preserve its ability to remove a non-performing general partner or managing member. The investor wants to preserve this ability in order to save the project and its investment in a timely manner. RAD wants to encourage the use of LIHTCs and, frankly, if the investor is able to move more quickly than HUD, everyone benefits. But what if the general partner is the PHA? How do you comply with the statutes ownership or control provisions while preserving this investor remedy?[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib11" id ="ref13" >11</a> </span> ]</p> <p>Everyone around the table wants to set up a system that works: lenders want to lend to these deals, investors want to invest, the PHAs and developers want to recapitalize, and HUD wants to preserve these units. How do you get there? Issues like these are where the Forum plays such a crucial role. The Forum and its members, who represent so many seats around the table, are able to organize meetings about the topics, focus the issues, discern consensus opinions, and generally move the discourse forward. Because of the Forum and its members playing these kinds of roles, we were collectively able to work out language that, as far as I know, has successfully allowed for lender and LIHTC participation in RAD.</p> <p>These are the roles the Forum played with the 2016 revisions to the RAD form documents as well.[ <span class="inDocLink"> <a href="#bib12" id ="ref14" >12</a> </span> ] When HUD drafted the initial versions of the RAD documents in 2012, it did so attempting to foretell how RAD would develop, but HUD did not always anticipate program developments correctly. Having put the documents through the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) process originally, the RAD team needed to revise, republish and re-authorize the documents when the PRA authority expired in 2016. Having discussed some of the documents and issues various parties have had over the past few years at roundtables and panel events, such as those at the Forum's annual meeting, the RAD team had a good sense of some of the changes that needed to be made. Indeed, the RAD team has made many improvements to the documents that it published for public comment in 2016. But the first published drafts of documents were not perfect. The Forum compiled comments from its members and submitted collective comments to highlight important issues. The comments received through the public comment process helped the RAD team make the documents stronger and more responsive to the program needs.</p> <p>Of course, when final, the RAD documents will still not be perfect, but as is the case with LIHTC and HUD's previous participation review, strong efforts have been made and continue to make significant improvement. It is up to the Forum and its members to continue dialogues devoted to improvement.</p> <span> <h3> <a href="#AN0121811283-6" id="AN0121811283-6">Conclusion</a> </h3> </span> <p>In conclusion: you, Forum members, may not realize the voice you have, but you have a strong voice and it is amplified through participation in the Forum. My colleagues at the HUD are good people who want to uphold their responsibilities as civil servants and want to implement policies and procedures that make sense. In every context I have witnessed, my colleagues and I have taken seriously comments, concerns, criticisms, praise, questions, explanations, and all other input received. There may be a sense out there that the federal government is disconnected or does not care or does not care enough to establish policies that make sense. Before I served in government, I thought submitting public comments was probably a waste of time. (Who would actually read them?!) Don't all agencies already know what they want to do and then just do it? This is not true. While the government may sometimes miss the mark, may sometimes have other mandates, or may sometimes be unable for any number of a plethora of reasons to achieve the ends that you or it may desire, your input is always taken very seriously. Your explanations and the context you provide are greatly appreciated. Your perspective is valuable. Ultimately, and so importantly, your participation in the process makes our policies and programs stronger.</p> <span> <a href="#AN0121811283-7" id="AN0121811283-7">Footnotes</a> </span> <p> <em> <a href="#ref1" id="bib1" >1.</a> HUD recently celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.
