# Talking Points + Hostile Q&A -- PETF (Housing Subsidy Reform)

## 12 talking points (tight, transition-ready)

1. **This is not new spending.** It is restructuring a portion of existing subsidy spend into a stabilization asset.
1. **Affordability is permanent.** CLT and limited-equity mechanisms prevent speculation and preserve long-run affordability.
1. **This is implementation-first.** Pilot, gate, evaluate, scale -- no magical thinking.
1. **It reduces downstream costs.** Stabilization lowers churn into shelter and repeated crisis cycles.
1. **It is auditable.** Annual reporting and evaluation are built in; results are tracked and disaggregated.
1. **It is pro-compliance.** Standardized legal templates, uniform covenants, fair-housing review, procurement controls.
1. **It is anti-fraud by design.** Eligibility, underwriting, and ongoing monitoring reduce gaming.
1. **It protects tenants.** Default mitigation, legal support linkages, and guardrails against predatory extraction.
1. **It is not forced.** Participation is voluntary and designed around readiness and stability.
1. **It is scalable only if it works.** Stop-loss triggers prevent runaway programs.
1. **It builds community wealth.** Households build limited equity; CLTs preserve affordability for the next household.
1. **It aligns with transition priorities.** Housing stability + fiscal discipline + measurable outcomes.

## Hostile Q&A (short answers you can say out loud)

### 1) "Isn't this just socialism?"

No. It is a finance + governance redesign: converting recurring rent spend into shared-equity ownership with permanent affordability controls.

### 2) "So you are taking subsidies away from needy renters?"

No. The pilot targets eligible participants and uses a voluntary pathway. The goal is to reduce long-term subsidy dependence through stability.

### 3) "Homeownership for very low-income households is risky."

Agreed -- if unmanaged. That is why the model includes underwriting standards, default mitigation, and permanent affordability structures. Pilot gating prevents overreach.

### 4) "Will this create windfalls or speculation?"

No. Limited-equity resale formulas and CLT ground leases cap appreciation and prevent flipping. Wealth-building is bounded and policy-driven.

### 5) "Does NYC even have legal authority to do this?"

Yes, if structured as enabling local law + administrative rules + standardized covenants and MOUs. The implementation package is drafted to be municipal-legible.

### 6) "What happens if someone defaults?"

Default mitigation first: forbearance/modification; then structured transfer pathways that preserve occupancy when possible and preserve affordability when not.

### 7) "This sounds administratively heavy."

It is less chaotic than perpetual crisis management. A dedicated program office + standard templates reduce bespoke casework over time.

### 8) "Why should the transition team touch this now?"

Because the first 90 days are when you can set the pilot architecture, select evaluators, and align agencies before budgets and calendars harden.

### 9) "Isn't this a distraction from building more housing?"

No -- this is about stabilizing households already in subsidy systems. It is complementary to supply strategies and reduces pressure on the shelter pipeline.

### 10) "How do you prevent discrimination or inequitable outcomes?"

Disaggregated reporting, fair-housing review, language access requirements, and explicit equity targets with public reporting and oversight.

### 11) "What is the single metric that proves it is working?"

Stability + cost: reduced churn into shelter / fewer crisis episodes and measurable household stabilization outcomes under a capped pilot budget.

### 12) "What is your weakest point?"

Capacity and sequencing. That is why the pilot is gated, partners are pre-qualified, and scale only follows verified performance.

## Close (final line)

"This is the grown-up version of housing policy: controlled scope, audited outcomes, permanent affordability, and a credible path from recurring spend to stability."
