# PART I: INTRODUCTORY LEGISLATION

## A LOCAL LAW

**To amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to establishing a public equity transfer framework for the conversion of rental housing subsidies into cooperative share ownership instruments**

**Be it enacted by the Council as follows:**

---

## TITLE 26 - CHAPTER 18
### PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER FRAMEWORK

### § 26-1801 Short title

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Public Equity Transfer Framework Act" or "PETF."

### § 26-1802 Legislative findings and declaration of policy

**(a) Findings.** The council hereby finds and declares that:

**(1)** New York City allocates in excess of five billion dollars annually in federal, state, and local housing subsidies, the substantial majority of which are paid directly to landlords as rental assistance;

**(2)** These rental subsidies, while providing critical short-term housing stability, do not generate wealth accumulation for recipient households or address structural inequities in homeownership access;

**(3)** Racial disparities in homeownership rates persist in New York City, with only twenty-seven percent of Black households and seventeen percent of Latino households owning homes, compared to forty-four percent of white households, as documented by the NYU Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy;

**(4)** Homeownership remains the single most significant mechanism for intergenerational wealth accumulation and economic mobility in the United States;

**(5)** The current rental subsidy model perpetuates a cycle wherein public funds subsidize private landlord profits without creating pathways to tenant ownership or equity accumulation;

**(6)** Limited-equity housing cooperatives represent a proven model for preserving long-term affordability while enabling collective tenant ownership and democratic governance;

**(7)** Properties receiving substantial concentrations of rental subsidies often experience chronic housing code violations, landlord neglect, and tenant harassment;

**(8)** The conversion of rental subsidies into equity-building instruments for cooperative ownership can reduce long-term public expenditures on emergency shelter, eviction prevention, and housing court costs;

**(9)** The District of Columbia's Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, enacted in 1980, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of tenant-initiated cooperative acquisitions;

**(10)** Federal housing choice voucher regulations permit flexibility in subsidy administration through Moving to Work waivers and demonstration programs;

**(11)** New York State cooperative corporations law provides a comprehensive legal framework for the formation and governance of limited-equity housing cooperatives;

**(12)** The city has successfully administered housing development fund corporation (HDFC) cooperatives for over fifty years, demonstrating institutional capacity for cooperative housing oversight; and

**(13)** A public equity transfer framework that redirects rental subsidies toward cooperative share purchases can simultaneously advance housing stability, wealth equity, and fiscal efficiency.

**(b) Declaration of policy.** It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city of New York to:

**(1)** Transform rental housing subsidies from consumption-only expenditures into asset-building instruments that generate intergenerational wealth;

**(2)** Promote collective tenant ownership as a mechanism for housing stability, community empowerment, and neighborhood resilience;

**(3)** Address systemic racial inequities in homeownership and wealth accumulation through targeted interventions in communities historically excluded from property ownership;

**(4)** Preserve long-term housing affordability through limited-equity resale restrictions and affordability covenants;

**(5)** Incentivize responsible property stewardship by enabling tenants to acquire buildings experiencing chronic neglect or code violations;

**(6)** Maximize return on public investment in housing assistance by reducing long-term costs associated with shelter systems, eviction proceedings, and tenant displacement;

**(7)** Support democratic tenant governance and capacity-building through technical assistance, legal services, and financial education;

**(8)** Coordinate federal, state, and local housing resources to create seamless pathways from rental tenancy to cooperative ownership; and

**(9)** Establish New York City as a national leader in equitable housing policy innovation.
