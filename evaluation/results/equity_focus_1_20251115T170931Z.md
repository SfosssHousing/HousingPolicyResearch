Title: Racial Equity Housing Subsidy Policy for NYC

Executive Summary:
The Racial Equity Housing Subsidy Policy aims to address the disparities in access to affordable housing for marginalized communities in New York City. By providing targeted subsidies to households facing racial discrimination and systemic barriers, this policy seeks to reduce disparities, improve access to safe and affordable housing, and promote racial equity in the housing market.

Background:
New York City is facing a housing crisis, with skyrocketing rents and a lack of affordable housing options disproportionately impacting communities of color. Structural racism and discriminatory housing practices have created barriers for marginalized communities to access safe and affordable housing. This policy aims to address these disparities by providing targeted subsidies to households facing racial discrimination and systemic barriers.

Actions:
1. Create a targeted housing subsidy program for households facing racial discrimination and systemic barriers.
2. Allocate funding for the subsidy program through the city's budget.
3. Partner with local housing organizations and community groups to identify eligible households and distribute subsidies.
4. Monitor and evaluate the impact of the subsidy program on reducing disparities and improving access to affordable housing for marginalized communities.

Fiscal Impact:
The implementation of the Racial Equity Housing Subsidy Policy will require an initial investment of $10 million in the city's budget. This funding will be used to provide subsidies to eligible households and cover administrative costs associated with the program. Additional funding may be required in future years to sustain and expand the program.

Timeline:
- Year 1: Develop and launch the subsidy program, identify eligible households, and distribute subsidies.
- Year 2: Monitor and evaluate the impact of the program, make any necessary adjustments, and expand the program to reach more households.
- Year 3 and beyond: Continue to monitor and evaluate the program, secure additional funding as needed, and make ongoing improvements to ensure the program is effectively reducing disparities and improving access to affordable housing for marginalized communities.

Metrics:
- Number of households receiving housing subsidies through the program
- Reduction in disparities in access to affordable housing for marginalized communities
- Increase in housing stability and affordability for subsidized households
- Community feedback and satisfaction with the program
