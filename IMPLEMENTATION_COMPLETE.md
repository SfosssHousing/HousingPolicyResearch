## How Each Document Solves Your Space's Needs

### Economic Framing (ROI Focus)

**Problem:** You need to frame housing subsidies as "equity investments" not welfare  
**Solution:** OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK §2 (DraftSection) includes prompt templates that ensure AI-generated content uses economic language

```
Prompt template:
"Analyze housing subsidy program using economic ROI framework.
Focus on: 
1. Cost per unit
2. Wealth accumulation for tenants
3. Tax base implications
4. Intergenerational equity returns"
```

### Legal Risk Management

**Problem:** Need Title IV/IX/ADA/504 risk review on all documents  
**Solution:** SPACE_INTEGRATION_PLAN §7 (Risk Radar) includes Persona pattern for civil-rights attorney

```
QA Gate: Legal Review
When: Before finalizing policy recommendations
Who: Civil-rights attorney persona
Check: Statutory compliance, discrimination risk, accessibility
```

### Budget Integration

**Problem:** Maximize use of existing agency budgets (HPD, HRA, NYCHA, HUD)  
**Solution:** BillSweep automation tracks all agency-related legislation, supporting TCAP model

```
Automated weekly tracking identifies:
- New funding streams
- Budget allocation changes
- Reallocation opportunities
- Existing infrastructure you can leverage
```

### Stakeholder Communication

**Problem:** Need briefing memos for city officials, councils, community boards  
**Solution:** OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK §2 (DraftSection) generates policy memos ready for distribution

```
Workflow:
1. Generate Executive Summary (DraftSection)
2. Generate Key Findings (DraftSection)
3. Generate Recommendations (DraftSection)
4. Manual review and finalization
5. Export to PDF/DOCX for distribution

Time: 2-3 hours vs. 6-8 hours manual
```
