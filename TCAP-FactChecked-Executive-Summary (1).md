# TCAP POLICY PROPOSAL
## FACT-CHECKED EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program**

---

## THE PROBLEM

**New York City's housing subsidy system enriches landlords without building tenant wealth**

### Current Reality
- **Over $5 billion annually** flows through rental assistance programs (CityFHEPS $1.1B, Section 8 $2.5B+, other programs $1.4B) [1][2]
- **Racial homeownership gap persists** (2021-2022): White 44%, Black 27%, Latino 17% [3]
- **Shelter costs unsustainable**: $99,000/year total ($45,000 city share) per family [4]
- **895,457 housing code violations** reported in FY2024, up 24% year-over-year [5]

### Why Current Subsidies Fail
- Voucher holders remain perpetual renters with zero wealth accumulation
- Subsidies flow to landlords as profit rather than tenant equity
- No pathway from rental assistance to homeownership
- Intergenerational inequality perpetuated through property exclusion

---

## THE SOLUTION: TCAP

**Convert rental subsidies into cooperative equity instruments**

### Core Mechanism
1. **Tenant associations** organize to acquire their buildings
2. **Rental subsidies redirect** to cooperative share purchases and building reserves
3. **Collective ownership** replaces landlord-tenant relationship
4. **30+ year affordability covenants** preserve long-term housing security

### Phased Subsidy Allocation Formula
- **Years 1-2:** 50% to equity/reserves, 50% to carrying charges
- **Years 3-4:** 65% to equity/reserves, 35% to carrying charges
- **Year 5+:** 75% to equity/reserves, 25% to carrying charges

---

## REVISED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

### Annual Cost Comparison (Per Unit)

**Status Quo Rental Subsidy Model:**
- Voucher/CityFHEPS payment: $20,000-$24,000
- Eviction prevention/court costs: $5,400
- Emergency shelter risk: $4,500
- Administrative overhead: $2,000
- **TOTAL: $31,900-$35,900/year**

**TCAP Cooperative Model:**
- Phased subsidy allocation: $18,000 (avg Years 1-5)
- Technical assistance: $1,200
- Compliance monitoring: $800
- Administrative overhead: $1,200
- Less: Eviction cost reduction: -$3,800
- **TOTAL: $17,400/year**

### **Annual Savings Per Unit: $14,500-$18,500**

---

## WEALTH BUILDING IMPACT

### Household Equity Accumulation
- **Year 5:** $18,000 average per household
- **Year 10:** $32,000 average per household
- **Total for 2,000 households:** $64,000,000 in permanent wealth

### Closing the Racial Homeownership Gap
- Current gap: 17 points (Black) and 27 points (Latino) below White homeownership
- **TCAP impact:** 4-6 percentage point reduction in gap
- Approximately 12-15% progress toward gap closure

## PROGRAM SCALE (10-YEAR PROJECTION)

| Year | Units Converted | Cumulative Households | Annual City Savings |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | 100 | 100 | $1,800,000 |
| 3 | 250 | 550 | $10,200,000 |
| 5 | 350 | 1,150 | $21,300,000 |
| 10 | 400 | 2,000 | $37,000,000 |

---

## HOUSING STABILITY OUTCOMES

### Eviction Reduction
- **Baseline:** 10-15% annual eviction filing rate
- **TCAP Target:** 2-4% eviction filing rate by Year 5
- **Reduction:** 60-75% fewer evictions

### Residential Tenure
- **Baseline:** 3-5 years average tenure
- **TCAP:** 12-15+ years average tenure
- **Result:** Dramatic reduction in displacement and housing instability

### Housing Cost Burden
- **Baseline:** 50-60% of income on housing
- **TCAP:** 25-35% of income by Year 5
- **Mechanism:** Phased subsidy reduction + no profit-seeking rent increases

## LEGAL FRAMEWORK SUMMARY

### Four Companion Bills

**INT. NO. ___ - A: Public Equity Transfer Framework Act**
- Creates legal mechanism for subsidy-to-equity conversion
- Establishes Tenant Opportunity Fund ($40M initial capitalization)
- Defines eligibility: 40%+ subsidy density, documented violations, tenant organization

**INT. NO. ___ - B: Subsidized Limited-Equity Cooperative Regulation Act**
- Creates new SLEC classification with regulatory oversight
- Mandates democratic governance (one-household-one-vote)

- Continuous program refinement and improvement

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Federal Coordination
- **HUD Moving to Work waiver** for subsidy flexibility
- CDBG funding allocation ($10M over 2 years)
- Housing Choice Voucher administrative adjustments

### State Partnership
- NYS Division of HCR regulatory oversight coordination
- State Attorney General cooperative compliance
- NY State Housing Trust Fund contributions ($5M)

### Local Infrastructure

## KEY TALKING POINTS

**For Council Members:**
- 2.9:1 return on investment with positive fiscal impact

- Democratic governance and local control
- Protection from displacement and gentrification
- Builds intergenerational wealth and community stability

**For Fiscal Conservatives:**
- Reduces long-term public expenditures on shelter and eviction response
- Creates revolving loan fund with repayments sustaining future acquisitions

## CONCLUSION

TCAP represents a **feasible, fiscally responsible, and transformative approach** to NYC's housing crisis. By redirecting existing subsidy expenditures into collective ownership structures, the program simultaneously:

✓ **Generates $374M in net public benefits over 10 years**  
✓ **Creates $64M in household wealth** for 2,000 families  
✓ **Reduces racial homeownership gap by 4-6 percentage points**  
✓ **Achieves 60-75% reduction in eviction rates**  
✓ **Establishes replicable national model** for equitable housing policy

**The time for transformative action is now.**
