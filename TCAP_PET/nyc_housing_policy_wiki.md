## Overview

New York City's housing policy framework operates through multiple interconnected programs designed to maintain housing affordability while protecting tenant rights and ensuring landlord viability. Unlike many states, New York does not have a single statewide rent control law; instead, the system is managed through a comprehensive rent regulation program created by the **Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (HSTPA)**, effective June 14, 2019.

### Key Statistics (2025)

- **Total NYC rental units affected by regulation:** ~1.1 million
- **Rent-stabilized units:** ~44% of NYC rental market
- **Rent-controlled units:** ~1% of rental market (phased out)
- **Section 8 households in NYC:** ~85,000-120,000 (largest program in the nation)
- **Total rental assistance programs (2024):** 352,000 NYC households

## Rent Stabilization Program

### Overview & Coverage

**What It Is:** Rent stabilization is a form of rent regulation that limits annual rent increases and provides lease renewal rights to tenants.

**Coverage:** Approximately 970,000 apartments in NYC (44% of rental market)

**Buildings Subject to Rent Stabilization:**

- Buildings with 6 or more units built before January 1, 1974

- Units not used as tenant's primary residence
- Co-op and condo conversions (existing tenants may retain, new sales exempt)

### Legal Framework

**Primary Statutes:**

- Lease term (1-year or 2-year) affects rent increase amounts
- Service reductions trigger rent reduction obligations

### Rent Increase Mechanisms

______________________________________________________________________

## Rent Control Program

### Overview

**Status:** Actively declining; covers only ~1% of NYC apartments (largely phased out)

**What It Is:** Traditional rent control (much stricter than rent stabilization) that limits rent increases based on Maximum Base Rent (MBR) system

**Eligibility:** Tenants occupying same apartment continuously since before June 30, 1974

**Application:** Primarily affects "preferential rent" apartments and stabilized units eligible for decontrol

### Legal Framework

**Primary Statutes:**

- New York State Rent Control Law (administered under ETPA legacy)
- Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974
- NY Real Property Law Article 26

### Maximum Base Rent (MBR) System

**How MBR Works:**

- DHCR determines a maximum base rent and maximum collectible rent for each controlled apartment
- Adjustments made every two years by DHCR
- Based on assessment of building operating costs + reasonable profit
- Building owners must apply for MBR adjustment (Form RA-28)
- Tenants can challenge adjustments based on:
  - Building has violations
  - Owner expenses don't warrant increase
  - Service reductions

**2026-27 MBR Application:**

- Owners must file and receive DHCR Order of Eligibility
- Use Owner Rent Regulation Application (ORRA) online system
- Expedited approval for buildings with zero HPD violations

### Tenant Protections Under Rent Control

- Stricter limits on rent increases than rent stabilization
- Lease renewal rights similar to stabilization
- Enhanced service protection provisions
- Greater challenge rights to owner-requested increases

### Decontrol & Phase-Out

**Decontrol Restrictions (2019 Amendments):**

- Eliminated vacancy bonus (previous mechanism for decontrol)
- Eliminated high-rent decontrol provisions
- All rent-controlled apartments now continue in regulation unless:
  - Tenant voluntarily vacates
  - Tenant becomes ineligible (moves out, loses occupancy)
  - Legal decontrol exceptions apply

**Decontrol Special Guidelines:**

- Special rent guidelines apply to units decontrolled after September 30, 2025
- Permissible increase: 49% above maximum base rent for initial decontrolled lease

## Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program

### Program Overview

**What It Is:** Federal rental subsidy program created by Housing and Community Development Act of 1978

**National Scope:** Over 5 million households nationally receive Housing Choice Vouchers

**NYC Administration:** NYCHA administers ~85,000 vouchers (largest program in the nation)

**NYC Participant Numbers:**

- Voucher holders: ~120,000 households
- Landlords participating: Over 25,000
- Demographics: ~40% children, ~16% age 61+, ~25% disabled

### Eligibility Requirements

**Income Limits (2025):**

- Determined by household size and NYC area limits
- Set at approximately 50% of Area Median Income (AMI)
- Examples (family of 4, approximate):
  - Gross annual income limit: ~$63,650
  - Monthly gross income: ~$5,304

**Family Size Income Limits:**

- 1 person: ~$37,500
- 2 persons: ~$42,900
- 3 persons: ~$48,250
- 4 persons: ~$53,600
- 5 persons: ~$57,950
- 6 persons: ~$62,300
- 7 persons: ~$66,650
- 8+ persons: Additional increment

**Other Requirements:**

- Valid SSN (for all household members)
- Background check (criminal history reviewed)
- No history of lease violations
- Monthly income certification

**Note:** Income must be verified at time of voucher issuance; income changes after issuance don't affect eligibility

### Program Structure & Operation

**Participant Cost Structure:**

- Tenant pays: 30-40% of adjusted monthly income toward rent
- NYCHA pays: Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) to landlord
- Payment formula: Rent - tenant contribution = NYCHA payment

**Housing Quality Standards:**

- Effective January 1, 2025: Transitioning to National Standard for Physical Inspection (NSPIRE)
- Unit must pass inspection before lease commencement and annually
- Standards cover: Safety, maintenance, utilities, accessibility
- Inspections conducted by NYCHA or authorized inspectors

### Landlord Requirements & Process

**Lease & Agreement Process:**

1. Landlord and tenant negotiate lease terms (within program parameters)
1. Unit must meet Housing Quality Standards
1. Lease submitted to NYCHA for approval
1. NYCHA issues Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) contract
1. Landlord receives monthly payment from NYCHA + tenant contribution

**Payment Process (2025):**

- NYCHA receives HUD funding first business day of month
- NYCHA processes landlord payments within one business day of receipt
- Payment includes: Rent minus tenant share
- Payment standard caps maximum rent NYCHA will cover

**Landlord Responsibilities:**

- Maintain unit in compliance with lease and program requirements
- Perform needed repairs promptly
- Maintain habitability standards
- Cooperate with inspections
- Provide lease-required services
- Accept tenant's Section 8 funding as partial/full rent

### Tenant Requirements & Obligations

**Participant Obligations:**

- Complete annual certification (household composition, income, assets)
- Accommodate NYCHA inspections (initial and annual)
- Allow landlord to make necessary repairs
- Comply with lease terms
- Report household composition changes
- Maintain home in good condition
- Pay rent share directly to landlord

**Failure to Comply Consequences:**

- Lease termination
- Eviction
- Removal from program
- Ineligibility for future vouchers

### Waitlist & Application Status (2025)

**Current Status:**

- Waitlist opened: June 3, 2024
- Application period closed: June 9, 2024, 11:59 PM
- Waitlist established: August 1, 2024
- **TEMPORARY PAUSE (effective August 1, 2025):**
  - NYCHA temporarily pausing voucher issuance to general HCV applicants
  - Reason: Transitioning Emergency Housing Vouchers (EHV) to traditional HCV program
  - EHV holders (~5,500 NYC households) migrating to HCV
  - General applicants returned to original waitlist position
  - Timeline: Pending changes in federal funding context

**How Voucher Issuance Works:**

- Applicants called off waitlist in order of application date + priority status
- Priority given to homeless, displaced, holding eviction notices
- Issuance paused pending EHV transition completion

### Rental Assistance Payment Coordination with Rent Regulation

**Key Policy Issue (Resolved 2022):**

- Conflict between rent-stabilized legal regulated rent and HAP contract rent
- Solution: December 2022 legislation (S7235) amended Private Housing Finance Law

**Current Law:**

- Owners of affordable housing properties with regulatory agreements may collect full HAP contract rent
- Even if property subject to rent stabilization
- After subsidy terminates, owner must default to legal regulated rent
- Regulatory agencies must audit compliance every 3 years
- Owners liable for rent overcharges if fail to default to regulated rent after subsidy ends

**Applicable Programs:**

- Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
- NYC 15/15 local rental assistance
- State/municipal subsidy programs

## Policy Analysis Notes for Analysts

### Current Policy Issues & Trends

**1. Federal Funding Uncertainty (Section 8)**

- EHV sunset creates immediate pressure on vulnerable households
- HCV funding levels at political risk; potential future reductions
- Policy opportunity: Advocate for HCV funding preservation and expansion
- Risk: Future federal cuts could eliminate 85,000 vouchers in NYC

**2. Rent Stabilization Sustainability Questions**

- Rent increase caps (3-4.5%) vs. operating cost inflation
- Deferred maintenance concerns in older buildings
- Policy tension: Affordability vs. building viability
- Possible future reforms: Hardship provisions, targeted increases

**3. Good Cause Eviction Implementation**

- New protection for market-rate tenants (48% of rental market)
- Local rent standard compliance still emerging
- Litigation expected to clarify provisions
- Policy note: Bridges gap between regulated (44%) and unregulated (48%) tenants

**4. Rental Assistance Program Fragmentation**

- Multiple programs with different rules (Section 8, NYC 15/15, SCRIE, DRIE, ERA)
- Coordination challenges; application burden on tenants
- Policy opportunity: Unified application, simplified income verification

**5. Affordability Crisis Context**

- 352,000 NYC households in rental assistance programs
- Millions more ineligible but cost-burdened (>30% income on rent)
- Waitlist lag: Thousands waiting for Section 8 eligibility
- Policy gap: Unmet demand for affordable housing

### Key Policy Questions for Future Research

- What is the long-term fiscal impact of current rent increase caps on property tax revenue?
- How many Section 8 vouchers could be created with additional federal/state funding?
