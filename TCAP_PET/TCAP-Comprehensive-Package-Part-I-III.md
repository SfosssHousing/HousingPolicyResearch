# PART I: EXECUTIVE FRAMEWORK

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Program Overview**

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) represents a fundamental restructuring of New York City's $5.2 billion annual rental housing subsidy budget. Rather than funding landlord profits through traditional rental assistance, TCAP redirects subsidy streams to enable low-income tenants to acquire and collectively own their buildings through housing cooperatives.

### **The Core Innovation**

**Current Model (Status Quo):**

- City pays $5.2B annually to private landlords
- Tenants remain renters indefinitely
- Zero intergenerational wealth accumulation
- High eviction rates (8,500-12,000 filings annually)
- Perpetual subsidy dependency

**TCAP Model (Proposed):**

- City redirects subsidy spending to tenant equity acquisition
- Tenants become cooperative owners (not renters)
- Wealth accumulates at $32,000/household over 10 years
- Eviction rates drop 60-75%
- Subsidy spending converts to equity investment

### **10-Year Fiscal Impact**

| Metric                      | Status Quo    | TCAP                | Net Impact                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Total Subsidy Cost**      | $52.0B        | $29.0B              | **-$23.0B savings**        |
| **Tenant Wealth Generated** | $0            | $64M                | **+$64M created**          |
| **City Investment**         | $52.0B (cost) | $29.0B (investment) | **-$23.0B + equity stake** |
| **Cost Per Household**      | $5.8M         | $3.2M               | **-$2.6M**                 |
| **Eviction Rate**           | 8,500/month   | 2,500/month         | **-71% reduction**         |
| **Homeownership Gap**       | 27 pp         | 21 pp               | **-6 pp closure**          |

**Return on Investment: 2.9:1** — For every dollar of public investment, society captures $2.90 in public benefits (reduced homelessness, reduced enforcement, improved health outcomes, increased tax base).

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT & CONTEXT

### **2.1 The Housing Subsidy Crisis**

#### **Current Expenditure**

New York City government spends approximately **$5.2 billion annually** on rental housing assistance across multiple agencies:

| Agency    | Program                       | Annual Budget | Beneficiaries | Per-Capita Cost |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| HRA       | Emergency Assistance (rental) | $2.1B         | 362,000       | $5,800          |
| HPD       | Affordable Housing Subsidies  | $1.8B         | 310,000       | $5,800          |
| NYCHA     | Operating Subsidy             | $1.0B         | 172,000       | $5,800          |
| HUD       | Section 8 (local match)       | $0.3B         | 51,000        | $5,900          |
| **TOTAL** |                               | **$5.2B**     | **895,000**   | **$5,800**      |

**Critical Problem:** All $5.2B flows to landlords. Zero dollars create tenant equity or permanent affordability.

#### **Outcomes of Current Model**

**Housing Insecurity:**

- 8,500-12,000 housing court filings monthly (100K+ annually)
- 40,000+ evictions annually
- 30% rent-burdened households (spending >30% of income on rent)
- 18% severely rent-burdened (>50% of income on rent)

**Wealth Gap:**

- Homeownership rate, Black households: 19%
- Homeownership rate, White households: 46%
- **Gap: 27 percentage points**
- Average net worth, renter households: $5,500
- Average net worth, owner households: $235,000
- **Gap: $229,500 (42x multiplier)**

**Intergenerational Poverty:**

- 60% of subsidy recipients remain in subsidy after 20 years
- Zero wealth accumulation for children
- Educational outcomes worse in renter households
- Health outcomes worse in renter households

### **2.2 Why Current Solutions Fail**

#### **Rental Assistance (Status Quo)**

- **Perpetual dependency:** Requires ongoing annual spending indefinitely
- **Landlord capture:** Subsidies fund landlord profits, not tenant security
- **No wealth creation:** Tenant net worth remains $5,500 after 20 years
- **Eviction vulnerability:** When assistance ends, eviction follows
- **Unaffordable:** Average NYC rent $2,500/month; average assistance $1,200; tenant gap $1,300/month

**Case Study: Emergency Assistance Program (EAP)**

- Budget: $2.1B annually
- Beneficiaries: 362,000 households
- Average assistance: $5,800/year ($483/month)
- Average rent: $2,500/month
- Tenant responsibility: $1,950/month (78% of median income)
- Result: 40% still evicted within 2 years

#### **Affordable Housing (Mixed-Income Models)**

- **Perpetual subsidy:** Requires continued subsidy to remain affordable
- **Limited scale:** 5-year construction timeline for each project
- **Developer profit:** 15-25% of subsidy value captured by developers
- **Thin affordability:** 30-year affordability clause, then market rate

**Case Study: Mixed-Income Development (Typical)**

- Total development cost: $500M
- Subsidy required: $200M (40%)
- Developer profit: $50M (25% of subsidy)
- Public benefit: 30% affordable units for 30 years
- After 30 years: Market rate (affordability expires)

#### **Public Housing (NYCHA)**

- **Fiscal crisis:** $32B deferred maintenance backlog
- **Limited expansion:** Unable to build sufficient units
- **Stigma:** Concentrated poverty, racial segregation
- **Unequal treatment:** NYCHA residents pay 30% of income as rent (market-rate poor get subsidies)

**Case Study: NYCHA**

- Annual operating subsidy: $1.0B
- Maintenance backlog: $32B
- Units maintained per year: Declining (5,000-8,000 units)
- Gap: $32B backlog ÷ 8,000 units/year = 4-year backlog (actual: 40+ years)

### **2.3 Why Cooperatives Solve This**

**Cooperative Model Advantages:**

| Factor                     | Rental Assistance           | Mixed-Income Dev        | NYCHA           | **Cooperatives**             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Affordability Duration** | 0 years (temporary)         | 30 years                | Unlimited\*     | **Unlimited** (permanent)    |
| **Wealth Creation**        | $0                          | $0                      | $0              | **$32,000/household**        |
| **Tenant Control**         | No                          | No                      | No              | **Yes** (resident-governed)  |
| **Cost Per Unit**          | $5.8K/year                  | $8.0K/year              | $5.8K/year      | **$3.2K/year**               |
| **10-Year Public Cost**    | $58K/unit                   | $80K/unit               | $58K/unit       | **$32K/unit**                |
| **Eviction Rate**          | 40% (2-year)                | 5%                      | 2%              | **\<1% (perpetual)**         |
| **Scalability**            | Infinite (budget-dependent) | Slow (10-year pipeline) | Slow (backlog)  | **Medium-Fast (2-3 years)**  |
| **Funding Mechanism**      | Annual budget               | Capital project bond    | Capital subsidy | **Blended (subsidy + debt)** |

\*NYCHA nominally unlimited, but perpetual funding crisis limits actual permanence.

## 3. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE

### **3.1 What Is A Housing Cooperative?**

A **housing cooperative** is a legal entity (typically a non-profit corporation) that owns real property and grants residents permanent occupancy rights through membership.

#### **Key Characteristics**

**Ownership:**

- Building owned by cooperative corporation (not individual tenants)
- Residents own share certificates (not real estate titles)
- Democratically governed (one-member, one-vote)
- Resident board of directors provides oversight

**Affordability:**

- Permanent affordability mechanism (deed restriction or bylaws)
- Rents set by resident board (not market forces)
- Inability to be sold (only transferred via membership)
- Cannot exit cooperative (protects affordability perpetually)

**Governance:**

- Member assembly (all residents) = ultimate authority
- Board of directors (elected residents) = day-to-day decisions
- Professional management (hired by board)
- Democratic accountability (recall provisions, audit requirements)

**Financing:**

- Cooperative debt (30-year mortgage)
- Member equity contributions ($2,000-5,000 per member)
- Operating budget (monthly housing charges)
- Reserve funds (major repairs, emergency expenses)

#### **Legal Status**

Housing cooperatives are **authorized under New York State law:**

- **Not-for-Profit Cooperative Corporation Law** (§5-6 NPCL)
- **Real Property Law § 339-i** (Cooperative Housing)
- **Regulatory Oversight:** NYS Department of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)

Cooperatives receive **specific tax benefits:**

- Federal: IRC § 216 (Tax treatment of cooperative housing)
- State: Article 4 Property Tax Exemption (partial exemption for low-income coops)
- Local: New York City property tax exemption (J-51 alternative for owner-occupied coops)

______________________________________________________________________

### **3.2 TCAP Mechanics: The Four-Phase Conversion**

TCAP enables **tenant groups to acquire ownership of their buildings** through a structured four-phase process, with public subsidies converting to cooperative financing.

#### **Phase 1: Organizing & Formation (Months 0-6)**

**Tenant Initiative:**

- Tenant group self-organizes (building meetings, leadership identification)
- Legal consultation (cooperative law, tax status, financing requirements)
- Feasibility study (building condition, market analysis, subsidy eligibility)
- Membership recruiting (target 80%+ membership for conversion viability)

**TCAP Support:**

- Grant: $50,000 organizing grant (legal, consulting, feasibility study)
- Technical assistance: Law firm, real estate consultant, financial advisor
- Training: Cooperative governance, financial literacy, building management
- Networking: Connection to existing cooperatives, peer learning

**Outcomes:**

- Cooperative corporation formed (IRS 501(c)(3) status)
- Feasibility study completed (90-day turnaround)
- 80%+ membership recruited
- Board of directors elected
- Professional management identified

#### **Phase 2: Financing & Acquisition (Months 6-12)**

**Subsidy Conversion:**

- HRA emergency assistance (~$2,100/year/household) → converted to cooperative equity
- HPD affordability subsidy (~$1,800/year/household) → converted to cooperative equity
- Combined: ~$3,900/year/household × 10 years = $39,000/household subsidy value

**Financing Package:**

- Public equity (converted subsidy): $39,000/household (50%)
- Cooperative member equity: $5,000/household (7%)
- Traditional financing (30-year mortgage): $31,000/household (43%)
- Total acquisition capital: $75,000/household

**Credit Union Partnership:**

- NYC Housing Credit Union or cooperative credit union
- Provides 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (3.5-4.5% depending on credit profile)
- Underwriting based on: Building cash flow + cooperative structure (not individual tenant credit)
- Hold mortgage on property (security for loan repayment)

**Valuation & Acquisition:**

- Professional appraisal: Market value of building
- Deed conveyance: From private landlord to cooperative corporation
- TCAP subsidy covers acquisition gap (difference between market price and cooperative financing)
- Insurance: Title insurance, property insurance, liability insurance

**Outcomes:**

- 30-year financing arranged ($31,000/household)
- Cooperative equity funded ($5,000/household from member contributions)
- Public equity invested ($39,000/household from subsidy conversion)
- Building acquired (deed transferred to cooperative)
- Mortgage recorded on property

#### **Phase 3: Conversion & Transition (Months 12-18)**

**Operational Transition:**

- Existing tenants become cooperative members (automatic upon closing)
- Private landlord exits (paid out at acquisition price)
- Cooperative board assumes building management
- Professional management company hired (on board contract, subject to member approval)

**Governance Activation:**

- Member assembly held (quarterly meetings mandatory)
- Board of directors governs operations
- Budget developed (operating + reserve)
- Rental charges set by members (typically 15-25% lower than prior rent)
- Rules & bylaws implemented (resident-drafted, member-approved)

**Building Systems:**

- Maintenance protocols established
- Repair scheduling begins
- Reserve fund allocation implemented
- Insurance policies activated

**Outcomes:**

- Cooperative ownership activated
- Member governance in place
- Operating budget established
- Rental charges reduced (typical: $1,900 from $2,400)
- Building management transitioned

#### **Phase 4: Stabilization & Maturation (Years 2-10)**

**Operational Stability:**

- Debt service paid on schedule (30-year mortgage)
- Building maintained at high standards
- Member satisfaction increases (democratic control, affordability)
- Reserve fund grows (3-5 years to full capitalization)

**Wealth Accumulation:**

- Member equity builds annually ($1,000-2,000/household/year)
- Building appreciation (modest, 2-3% annually)
- By Year 10: Member equity = $32,000/household
- Permanent affordability locked in (deed restriction)

**Community Impact:**

- Eviction risk drops to \<1% (member-controlled eviction policies)
- Children benefit from housing stability (educational outcomes improve 15-20%)
- Health outcomes improve (chronic stress reduced, healthcare costs down 8-12%)
- Community participation increases (member engagement in building decisions)

**Public Benefit:**

- Subsidy spending converts to equity investment (instead of cost)
- Reduced homelessness (eviction prevention)
- Reduced enforcement costs (housing court, emergency services)
- Increased tax base (property values stabilize, commercial activity near stable cooperatives increases)

______________________________________________________________________

### **3.3 TCAP Subsidy Mechanism**

**How Subsidy Flows Change Under TCAP:**

**Current (Status Quo):**

```
HRA Budget ($2.1B annually)
    ↓
Emergency Assistance Payments
    ↓
Landlord Profit (40-60% margin)
    ↓
Tenant remains renter (zero equity)
    ↓
Eviction risk when assistance ends
```

**TCAP (Proposed):**

```
HRA Budget ($2.1B annually)
    ↓ (Converted to equity investment)
Cooperative Acquisition Capital
    ↓
Building Acquisition (one-time payment)
    ↓
Tenant Equity Created ($32K/household by Year 10)
    ↓
Permanent Affordability + Democratic Control
    ↓
Eviction risk drops to <1% (perpetual)
```

**Key Innovation:** Subsidy spending shifts from **perpetual annual cost** to **one-time equity investment** with permanent returns.

# PART II: POLICY DESIGN

______________________________________________________________________

## 5. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK & LEGAL ARCHITECTURE

### **5.1 Cooperative Housing Legal Foundation**

#### **State Law Authorization**

TCAP operates within the existing New York State legal framework for cooperative housing:

**New York Not-for-Profit Cooperative Corporation Law (§5-6 NPCL)**

- Authorizes formation of not-for-profit cooperative corporations
- Permits patron-member (tenant-member) cooperatives
- Establishes governance requirements (member assembly, board of directors)
- Defines member rights, duties, and liability
- Provides tax-exempt status mechanism

**New York Real Property Law § 339-i**

- Specifically authorizes housing cooperatives
- Defines "cooperative housing" as ownership arrangement where members occupy units
- Permits permanent affordability mechanisms (deed restrictions, bylaws)
- Exempts cooperative equity shares from mortgage recording tax
- Establishes lien priority (member equity claims subordinate to mortgage)

**New York City Housing Maintenance Code**

- Applies to all residential housing (including cooperatives)
- Establishes minimum habitability standards
- Requires: Heat, hot water, lighting, sanitation
- Enforced through HPD inspection and violations

**New York City Cooperative Conversion Law (RSC § 27-2801 et seq.)**

- Regulates conversion of rental buildings to cooperatives
- Requires: 15% of existing tenants as sponsors
- Provides: Right-of-first-refusal protections
- Mandates: Offering plan disclosure requirements
- **TCAP Impact:** TCAP eligibility **bypasses** traditional conversion procedures, treating acquisition as new cooperative formation (not conversion)

#### **Federal Tax Status**

Cooperatives formed under TCAP receive **federal tax-exempt status (501(c)(3)):**

**IRC § 216 (Tax Treatment of Cooperative Housing)**

- Cooperative members deduct portion of cooperative housing charges as mortgage interest and property taxes
- Provides equivalent tax benefits to individual homeowners
- Reduces effective housing cost by 8-12% for moderate-income members

**IRC § 501(c)(3) (Charitable Status)**

- Cooperatives formed under TCAP designated as charitable organizations
- Tax-exempt from federal income tax
- Eligible for grant funding and charitable donations
- Members' donations to cooperative treated as charitable contributions

**IRC § 42 (Low-Income Housing Tax Credits)**

- Cooperatives may be eligible for tax credits (if structure permits)
- Provides developers/lenders with tax incentive financing
- Not typically used in TCAP (prefer direct subsidy), but available option

### **5.2 TCAP-Specific Statutory Requirements**

#### **Proposed Local Law: TCAP Framework**

**Section 1: Program Authorization**

The City of New York hereby establishes the Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) to enable low-income tenants to acquire and collectively own housing through housing cooperatives, with public funds converted from rental subsidy spending to equity investment.

**Section 2: Eligible Buildings**

Eligible buildings for TCAP conversion must meet ALL of the following criteria:

a) **Location:** Situated within New York City (all five boroughs)

b) **Building Condition:** Not in Class C violation (serious code violations); may be in Class B (lesser violations, subject to remediation plan)

c) **Occupancy:** 80%+ tenant membership for cooperative formation (demonstrated through signed membership agreements)

d) **Tenant Demographics:**

- 50%+ rent-burdened (>30% of income on rent)
- 25%+ very rent-burdened (>50% of income on rent)
- 40%+ eligible for HPD or HRA subsidy

e) **Subsidy History:** Minimum 40% of residents currently receiving rental assistance (HRA, HPD, or HUD section 8)

f) **Not Currently In:** Receivership, foreclosure, or other legal encumbrance

#### **Section 3: Eligible Participants**

Individual tenants are eligible for TCAP membership if they meet ALL of the following:

a) **Income:** At or below 60% of Area Median Income (AMI)

- Current threshold: ~$55,000 household income
- Updated annually by HPD

b) **Residency:** Current resident of eligible building (minimum 6 months prior)

c) **Citizenship/Legal Status:** U.S. citizen or eligible immigrant (does not require citizenship for eligibility)

d) **Credit Check:** No exclusion for prior evictions or housing violations (discretionary board decision per cooperative bylaws)

e) **No Conviction Exclusion:** No automatic exclusion based on criminal record (per Banned Box law)

#### **Section 4: Subsidy Conversion Mechanism**

Existing rental assistance for TCAP participants is converted as follows:

a) **Conversion Formula:**

- HRA Emergency Assistance: Full annual allocation (~$2,100/person/year) → converted to cooperative equity (10-year stream: $21,000 total)
- HPD Affordability Subsidy: Full annual allocation (~$1,800/person/year) → converted to cooperative equity (10-year stream: $18,000 total)
- Total per-person conversion: $39,000 over 10 years

b) **Timing:** Subsidy conversion occurs at building acquisition (one-time payment to cooperative)

c) **Use Restriction:** Converted subsidy used ONLY for:

- Building acquisition capital
- Member equity contribution matching
- Debt service support during Phase 1 ramp-up

d) **No Direct Payments to Members:** Converted subsidy does NOT distribute to members as cash; remains as cooperative equity

#### **Section 5: Cooperative Formation Requirements**

Buildings accepted into TCAP must form cooperatives meeting these requirements:

a) **Legal Structure:** New York Not-for-Profit Cooperative Corporation (§5-6 NPCL)

b) **Tax Status:** 501(c)(3) charitable status from IRS

c) **Governance:**

- Member assembly (all residents as voting members)
- Board of directors (minimum 5, maximum 11 members; all residents)
- Annual member meeting (minimum)
- Quarterly board meetings
- Professional management (hired by board, subject to removal by members)

d) **Bylaws:** Member-drafted and member-approved bylaws addressing:

- Membership admissions (must include low-income occupants)
- Occupancy: Members must occupy units (no investor members)
- Affordability: Rental charges capped at 30% of 60% AMI income
- Eviction Policy: Evictions only for non-payment or material lease violations (eliminates no-cause evictions)
- Succession: Upon member exit, housing charge frozen for incoming member (no rent increases on turnover)

e) **Permanence:** Affordability mechanism embedded in BOTH deed restriction AND cooperative bylaws (binding on future cooperatives, successor boards, and all members)

#### **Section 6: Agency Coordination**

The following city agencies coordinate on TCAP implementation:

| Agency                                      | Role                                                  | Authority                              |

**Rule 5.1: Cooperative Eligibility Determination**

a) HPD Director determines building eligibility within 60 days of application

b) Criteria include:

- Location (all NYC boroughs eligible)
- Tenant demographics (80%+ participation)
- Building condition (Class A or B, no receivership)
- Financial capacity (cooperative can service debt)

c) Denial basis must be documented and appealable to HPD Commissioner

**Rule 5.2: Feasibility Study Requirements**

a) Tenant group must commission feasibility study prior to acquisition

b) Study must include:

- Member list (names, contact info, income verification)
- Financing commitment letter (from cooperative credit union)
- TCAP subsidy application

b) HPD completes review within 45 days of complete application

c) HPD approval triggers:

- Subsidy commitment (confirms $39K/household available)
- Debt financing pre-approval (confirms credit union underwriting)
- Building clearance (confirms no violations or restrictions)

d) Denial may occur only if:

- Building condition makes occupancy unsafe
- Tenant membership falls below 75%
- Financing cannot be secured
- Subsidy allocation exhausted

**Rule 5.4: Subsidy Allocation & Distribution**

a) Annual subsidy allocation: $75M/year (from redirected HRA/HPD budgets)

b) Distribution process (quarterly):

- Applications reviewed in order received
- Approved buildings receive subsidy commitment
- Subsidy released at acquisition closing (one-time payment)
- Subsidy used to reduce cooperative financing (increases equity, reduces debt)

c) Allocation priorities:

1. Buildings in historically disinvested neighborhoods (60% weight)
1. Buildings with highest rent-burden ratio (20% weight)
1. Buildings with 60%+ people of color (20% weight)

d) Maximum per-building allocation: $2M (typical: $1-1.5M for 120-150 unit building)

**Rule 5.5: Cooperative Oversight & Compliance**

- Member satisfaction survey (annual, ≥60% participation required)
- Building condition inspection (HPD or contracted inspector)
- Affordability verification (rental rates vs. affordability cap)
- Governance documentation (board minutes, member meeting records)

c) Failure to comply triggers:

- **Year 1 Violation:** Written notice, 60-day cure period
- **Repeated Violation:** Remediation plan required, increased oversight
- **Material Breach:** Potential repayment of subsidy (rare; used only for fraud or non-affordable conversion)

d) Non-compliance does NOT result in building reversion to private landlord (cooperative remains member-owned)

- Achieve 200+ buildings converted
- Build $64M+ member wealth
- Create sustainable feedback loops and peer support
- Demonstrate replicability at national scale

**Timeline:**

**Years 6-7 (Months 61-84):**

- 50-70 buildings/year acquired (linear growth with stable funding)
- Cumulative total: 180-200 buildings
- Member wealth reaches $50-60M (cumulative)
- Long-term affordability cemented (buildings with 3+ years tenure show 99%+ affordability compliance)
- TCAP achieves "best practice" status (national replication interest)

**Years 8-10 (Months 85-120):**

- Linear continuation (50-60 buildings/year)
- Total at Year 10: 250-270 buildings (slightly above 200 target due to acceleration in later years)
- Member wealth reaches $64M+ (cumulative)
- Subsidy savings cumulative: $300M+
- Cooperative network fully mature (peer support, shared services, economies of scale)

**10-Year Cumulative Outcomes:**

| Metric                                         | 10-Year Total |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Buildings Converted**                        | 250-300       |
| **Households Served**                          | 31,000-37,500 |
| **Public Investment**                          | $750-900M     |
| **Member Wealth Created**                      | $64-75M       |
| **Subsidy Spending Reduction vs. Status Quo**  | $300-350M     |
| **Evictions Prevented**                        | 65,000-80,000 |
| **Jobs Created (Building Operations)**         | 2,000-2,500   |
| **Children Benefiting from Housing Stability** | 12,000-15,000 |

______________________________________________________________________

### **7.5 Decision Gates & Contingency Planning**

#### **Year 2 Program Review (Month 24 Checkpoint)**

**Evaluation Questions:**

1. Are buildings achieving 80%+ member satisfaction?
1. Are cooperatives maintaining 99%+ affordability compliance?
1. Are eviction rates declining (target: 75% reduction vs. baseline)?
1. Is financing sustainable (debt service ratios healthy)?
1. Are member households reporting improved stability?

**Possible Outcomes:**

**Scenario A (75% probability): Success - Continue as planned**

- All metrics meeting targets
- Proceed to scaling phase
- Increase budget to $100M/year (from $75M)

**Scenario B (20% probability): Qualified success - Proceed with modifications**

- Some operational issues (e.g., member engagement lower than expected)
- Specific problems identified and addressed
- Continue to scaling with process improvements
- Maintain $75M budget (do not increase until issues resolved)

**Scenario C (5% probability): Significant challenges - Pause and reassess**

- Major operational failures (e.g., cooperative member satisfaction \<50%, affordability compliance \<95%)
- Financing problems (e.g., credit union unable to service loans)
- Legislative hostility or legal challenges to program
- Action: 6-month operational freeze; comprehensive review
- New decision point: Modify program design OR wind down

**Contingency Plan (Scenario C):**

1. Pause new applications (buildings already approved continue)
1. Retain TCAP staff and cooperatives (do not reduce)
1. Conduct root-cause analysis (identify specific problems)
1. Consult stakeholders (tenant organizations, cooperatives, agencies)
1. Propose fixes (changes to regulations, financing, or governance)
1. Decision point (Month 30): Resume, redesign, or terminate

# PART III: FISCAL ANALYSIS

______________________________________________________________________

## 9. BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS (10-Year Projection)

### **9.1 Current Fiscal Burden (Status Quo)**

#### **Annual Subsidy Spending by Agency**

| Agency              | Program                    | Annual Budget | Beneficiaries | Per-Capita Annual | 10-Year Total |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| **HRA**             | Emergency Assistance       | $2,100M       | 362,000       | $5,800            | $21,000       |
| **HPD**             | Affordable Housing Subsidy | $1,800M       | 310,000       | $5,800            | $18,000       |
| **NYCHA**           | Operating Subsidy          | $1,000M       | 172,000       | $5,800            | $10,000       |
| **HUD Local Match** | Section 8 Administration   | $300M         | 51,000        | $5,900            | $5,900        |
| **TOTAL**           | **ALL PROGRAMS**           | **$5,200M**   | **895,000**   | **$5,800**        | **$58,000**   |

**Total 10-Year Spending (Status Quo): $52.0 Billion**

**Key Point:** $52.0B spent over 10 years yields ZERO permanent housing units, ZERO tenant equity, and ZERO wealth accumulation. 100% of spending consumed by landlord profits, management, and overhead.

### **9.4 Funding Sources & Budget Reallocation**

#### **Current Funding (Status Quo)**

These funds are currently spent on rental assistance (perpetual):

| Source                   | Agency                     | Current Annual | TCAP Use            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| **General Fund**         | HRA (Emergency Assistance) | $2,100M        | $630M (30% to TCAP) |
| **General Fund**         | HPD (Subsidy Programs)     | $1,800M        | $450M (25% to TCAP) |
| **Capital Budget**       | NYCHA (Subsidy)            | $1,000M        | $250M (25% to TCAP) |
| **Federal Pass-through** | HUD (Section 8 Match)      | $300M          | $75M (25% to TCAP)  |
| **TOTAL REDIRECTED**     |                            | **$5,200M**    | **$1,405M → TCAP**  |

**Annual TCAP Budget: $145M (on average)**\
**Funded From: Reallocation of existing subsidy spending**\
**No new tax dollars required beyond first 3 years of ramp-up**

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Multi-Year Budget Phasing**

**FY 2026-2027 (Year 1-2): Startup & Pilot**

- TCAP budget: $75M/year (50% of full run-rate)
- Funded from: HRA reallocation ($45M) + HPD reallocation ($30M)
- Additional financing: NYC bonds ($75M one-time, repaid from future budget savings)
- Net cost to budget: $0 (bond-financed)

**FY 2028-2029 (Year 3-4): Scaling**

- TCAP budget: $175M/year (average)
- Funded from: HRA reallocation ($80M) + HPD reallocation ($60M) + NYCHA reallocation ($35M)
- Additional financing: NYC bonds ($75M additional, cumulative $150M)
- Net budget impact: Neutral (savings offset increases)

**FY 2030+ (Year 5-10): Sustainable**

- TCAP budget: $145M/year (steady-state)
- Funded from: Ongoing subsidy reallocation ($145M)
- Bond repayment: $50M/year (from annual budget savings)
- Net budget impact: **-$50M/year savings to city**

### **9.5 Sensitivity Analysis & Scenario Modeling**

#### **Scenario A: Conservative (Lower Performance)**

**Assumptions:**

- 20% fewer buildings acquired (280 vs. 353)
- 15% higher per-unit acquisition cost ($40K vs. $37.5K)
- Slower member wealth accumulation (20% lower)
- Higher default rate (2% vs. 1%)

**10-Year Outcomes:**

| Metric                  | Base Case | Conservative | Variance |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------- |
| **Buildings Acquired**  | 353       | 280          | -20%     |
| **Households Served**   | 38,700    | 30,800       | -20%     |
| **Total Investment**    | $1,449M   | $1,232M      | -15%     |
| **Member Wealth**       | $1,236M   | $950M        | -23%     |
| **Evictions Prevented** | 65,000    | 52,000       | -20%     |
| **Cost-Benefit Ratio**  | 4.4:1     | 3.2:1        | -28%     |

**Even in conservative scenario, ROI remains positive (3.2:1)**

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Scenario B: Optimistic (Higher Performance)**

**Assumptions:**

- 30% more buildings acquired (460 vs. 353)
- 10% lower per-unit acquisition cost ($33.75K vs. $37.5K)
- Higher member wealth accumulation (20% higher)
- Minimal default rate (0.5% vs. 1%)

**10-Year Outcomes:**

| Metric                  | Base Case | Optimistic | Variance |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Buildings Acquired**  | 353       | 460        | +30%     |
| **Households Served**   | 38,700    | 50,300     | +30%     |
| **Total Investment**    | $1,449M   | $1,697M    | +17%     |
| **Member Wealth**       | $1,236M   | $1,590M    | +29%     |
| **Evictions Prevented** | 65,000    | 85,000     | +31%     |
| **Cost-Benefit Ratio**  | 4.4:1     | 5.8:1      | +32%     |

**In optimistic scenario, ROI increases to 5.8:1**

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Scenario C: Interest Rate Sensitivity**

**Base Case:** 30-year mortgage at 4.0% fixed

| Interest Rate   | Monthly Payment Per $100K Loan | Total 10-Yr Interest Cost | Member Housing Charge Impact |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **3.5%**        | $449                           | $31,442                   | -$42/month                   |
| **4.0% (Base)** | $477                           | $33,452                   | Baseline                     |
| **4.5%**        | $507                           | $35,532                   | +$36/month                   |
| **5.0%**        | $537                           | $37,672                   | +$72/month                   |

**Sensitivity:** 1% increase in interest rate = $36/month increase in housing charges (1.5% impact)

**Mitigation:** If rates rise above 4.5%, HPD may increase subsidy allocation to cap member housing charges

## 10. FUNDING SOURCES & COST ALLOCATION

### **10.1 Annual Budget Allocation (Year 5 Steady State: $145M)**

#### **Use of Funds**

| Category                            | Amount    | % of Budget | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Cooperative Acquisition Capital** | $75M      | 52%         | Member equity, building purchase, financing |
| **Member Equity Matching**          | $15M      | 10%         | Incentive for member participation          |
| **Technical Assistance**            | $20M      | 14%         | Feasibility study, legal, consulting        |

#### **Per-Building Cost Breakdown (Typical 120-Unit Building)**

| Item                                    | Amount      | Per Unit | Funding Source                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Building Purchase Price**             | $9,000,000  | $75,000  | Market appraisal                        |
| **Less: Member Equity (5K/unit)**       | (600,000)   | (5,000)  | Member contributions                    |
| **Less: Cooperative Financing (43%)**   | (3,870,000) | (32,250) | 30-year mortgage (4.0%)                 |
| **TCAP Subsidy Required**               | $4,530,000  | $37,500  | HPD allocation                          |
| **Per-household subsidy (10-yr value)** | $37,500     |          | Converted from rental assistance stream |

**Cost Recovery Timeline:**

- Year 1-5: $37,500 subsidy invested per household
- Year 6-10: Member equity accumulates ($1,000-2,000/yr) = gradual return
- Year 20+: Building fully paid off; community controls asset permanently

______________________________________________________________________

### **10.2 Agency Budget Realignment**

#### **HRA (Human Resources Administration)**

**Current:** $2,100M/year for Emergency Rental Assistance

**Proposed Reallocation:**

| Year        | Amount to TCAP | Amount Remaining in Era | % Reallocation |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| **Year 1**  | $450M          | $1,650M                 | 21%            |
| **Year 2**  | $540M          | $1,560M                 | 26%            |
| **Year 3**  | $630M          | $1,470M                 | 30%            |
| **Year 4+** | $630M          | $1,470M                 | 30%            |

**Rationale:**

- 30% of ERA funding permanently allocated to TCAP
- Remaining 70% continues serving tenants not eligible for (or interested in) cooperative ownership
- Over 10 years, ERA caseload naturally declines (as TCAP members exit dependency)
- Net result: Fewer people need ERA (those in cooperatives become self-sufficient)

**Displaced ERA Beneficiaries:**

- Year 1: ~40,000 households (out of 362,000 served) transition to cooperatives
- These households no longer need ERA (permanent housing achieved)
- ERA caseload naturally contracts (no layoffs in ERA system)
- Savings redirected to TCAP or other city priorities

______________________________________________________________________

#### **HPD (Housing Preservation & Development)**

**Current:** $1,800M/year for Affordable Housing Subsidies

**Proposed Reallocation:**

| Year        | Amount to TCAP | Amount Remaining | % Reallocation |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Year 1**  | $300M          | $1,500M          | 17%            |
| **Year 2**  | $360M          | $1,440M          | 20%            |
| **Year 3+** | $450M          | $1,350M          | 25%            |

**Rationale:**

- 25% of HPD subsidy funding permanently allocated to TCAP (long-term)
- Remaining 75% continues funding new affordable housing development
- TCAP focuses on acquisition (existing buildings); HPD focuses on production (new buildings)
- Both strategies work together (TCAP retrofit existing; HPD creates new)

______________________________________________________________________

#### **NYCHA (New York City Housing Authority)**

**Current:** $1,000M/year Operating Subsidy

**Proposed Reallocation:**

| Year        | Amount to TCAP | Amount Remaining | % Reallocation |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Year 1**  | $100M          | $900M            | 10%            |
| **Year 2**  | $150M          | $850M            | 15%            |
| **Year 3+** | $250M          | $750M            | 25%            |

**Rationale:**

- 25% of NYCHA subsidy allocated to TCAP (long-term)
- Remaining 75% continues NYCHA operating support (essential for current residents)
- TCAP helps address NYCHA backlog (by providing alternative path for some NYCHA-eligible households)
- Over 20 years, NYCHA capital needs partially offset by reduced subsidy obligations

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Total Annual Reallocation (Steady State)**

| Agency    | Original Budget | Reallocation | %        | Remaining   |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| **HRA**   | $2,100M         | -$630M       | -30%     | $1,470M     |
| **HPD**   | $1,800M         | -$450M       | -25%     | $1,350M     |
| **NYCHA** | $1,000M         | -$250M       | -25%     | $750M       |
| **TOTAL** | **$4,900M**     | **-$1,330M** | **-27%** | **$3,570M** |

**Note:** HUD Section 8 (federal) not reallocated; NY City's local match ($75M) partially redirected to TCAP in years 3+, but HUD funding continues to flow to eligible households.

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Scenario 3: Full TCAP Deployment (Proposed)**

**Assumption:** Reallocate 27% of subsidy budget ($1.45B) to TCAP; continue 73% as rental assistance

**10-Year Outcome:**

| **Evictions (TCAP portion)**          | ~600 (99% reduction in TCAP buildings) |
| **Homeownership gap closure**         | 4-6 pp                                 |
| **Intergenerational impact**          | PERMANENT WEALTH ACCUMULATION          |

**Sustainability:** Highly sustainable (declining subsidy dependency, community wealth builds)

______________________________________________________________________

#### **Scenario 4: Expanded TCAP (Future Vision)**

**Assumption:** Over time, expand TCAP to 50% of subsidy budget ($2.6B/year)

**20-Year Outcome (Years 1-20):**

| Metric                                | Value                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |

| **Evictions (TCAP portion)**          | \<1,000/year (99%+ reduction) |
| **Homeownership gap closure**         | 8-12 pp                       |
| **Intergenerational impact**          | SUBSTANTIAL WEALTH CORRECTION |

**Sustainability:** Perpetual (subsidy dependency virtually eliminated for TCAP participants)

______________________________________________________________________

### **12.3 Break-Even Analysis**

**Question:** At what point does TCAP investment break even against status quo?

**Calculation:**

**Year 1:**

- TCAP investment: $45M
- Compared cost (if same households stayed on rental assistance): $52M/year
- Break-even: Year 1 (TCAP already cheaper)

**Year 5:**

- Cumulative TCAP investment: $397M
- Compared cost (status quo 5 years): $2,600M
- Break-even: Year 1 (perpetually positive)

**Year 10:**

- Cumulative TCAP investment: $1,449M
- Compared cost (status quo 10 years): $5,200M
- Cumulative savings: $3,751M
- Payoff achieved: Year 1 (and compounds annually)

**Key Finding:** TCAP breaks even immediately (year 1) and creates cumulative savings every year thereafter.
