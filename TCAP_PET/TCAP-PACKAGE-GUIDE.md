## 📊 KEY STATISTICS TO MEMORIZE

### The Problem

- **$5B:** Annual NYC housing subsidy (goes to landlord profits, not member wealth)
- **27 pp:** Black-White homeownership gap (19% Black vs. 46% White)
- **40,000+:** Annual evictions (despite $5B subsidy)
- **$260K:** Racial wealth gap (Black median $24K vs. White median $284K)
- **60%:** Households spending >30% income on rent

### The Solution

- **TCAP:** Redirects subsidies from rent assistance to permanent ownership
- **Cooperatives:** Member-controlled, permanent affordability, no landlord
- **Deed Restriction:** Affordability locked in perpetuity (legal protection)
- **40-year precedent:** DC TOPA (25K households), SF COPA (100+ buildings)

### The Impact (10-Year)

- **353:** Buildings acquired
- **38,650:** Households served
- **$1.24B:** Member wealth created ($32K per household)
- **65,000+:** Evictions prevented
- **$37.5B:** Public subsidy savings (vs. status quo)
- **3.4:1:** Direct financial ROI
- **6.2:1:** Full societal ROI
