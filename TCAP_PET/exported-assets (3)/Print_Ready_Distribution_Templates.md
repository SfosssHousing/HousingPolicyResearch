## SECTION 4: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (1-PAGE PRINT VERSION)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
              PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER ACT
                    INT A-[XXXX]

THE PROBLEM
New York City spends nearly $680 million annually on housing 
subsidies—but these programs trap families in poverty without 
building wealth. The average subsidized tenant spends 50-60% of 
income on rent and has zero equity after 20 years. Meanwhile, 
the racial homeownership wealth gap persists: white families 
hold 10x more home equity than Black families.

THE SOLUTION
The Public Equity Transfer (PET) Act restructures existing 
subsidies into tenant ownership. Eligible families earning up 
to 120% AMI can use a portion of their housing subsidy as a 
down payment toward homeownership. The city partners with:
  • Community Land Trusts (maintain affordability)
  • Credit unions (provide mortgages)
  • HPD (administer program via new Public Equity Transfer Office)

HOW IT WORKS
1. Eligible household identified (rent payment history, income 
   verification)
2. City provides 20% down payment assistance ($85K average)
3. Credit union finances 30-year mortgage at 5.8% fixed rate
4. Property held via CLT ground lease (affordability protected)
5. Family builds equity; CLT retains land for perpetual 
   affordability

FISCAL IMPACT (10-Year Projection)
  • 5,600 households transition to ownership
  • $680 million in subsidy deployed
  • $138.8 million in homeowner equity created
  • $197.4 million in community assets (CLTs)
  • $133.4 million in new property tax revenue
  • 1.296x municipal ROI (city recovers $1.30 for every $1 invested)

EQUITY OUTCOMES (Year 10)
  • 40% of beneficiaries: BIPOC families (meets policy target)
  • 46% of beneficiaries: Low-moderate income (50-80% AMI)
  • 35% of beneficiaries: Single-parent households
  • Intergenerational wealth transfer: $572.6 million total

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
  • Phase I (Years 1-3): 750 conversions/year; partner recruitment
  • Phase II (Years 4-7): 1,250 conversions/year; scaled capacity
  • Phase III (Years 8-10): 1,700 conversions/year; system optimization

SAFEGUARDS
  • 30-year affordability covenants recorded on deeds
  • Right-of-first-refusal for CLTs on all resales
  • Resale formula caps appreciation; CLTs recapture excess equity
  • 120-day forbearance for borrowers facing default
  • Annual equity reporting disaggregated by race, income, borough
  • 10-year sunset (Dec 31, 2035) with mandatory reauthorization

WHY NOW
NYC is experiencing the worst housing affordability crisis in 
a generation. Traditional subsidies are unsustainable. Community 
Land Trusts are already operating successfully in 12 NYC 
neighborhoods. Credit unions have proven affordable lending 
expertise. The PET Act connects these proven solutions and 
scales what works—using existing city budget, not new money.

╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

WHAT IS THE PET ACT?
A new law that converts NYC housing subsidies ($680M/year) into 
tenant ownership. Instead of renting forever with no equity, 
low-income families can build permanent wealth through homeownership.

WHO QUALIFIES?
• Income: Up to 120% of Area Median Income (AMI)
  - In NYC, that's roughly $100K-$120K for a family of 4
• Housing history: 12+ months of consistent rent payments
• Age: 18+; no credit score minimum
• Status: All immigration statuses welcome

WHAT'S THE DOWN PAYMENT?
• City provides: 20% down payment assistance ($85K average)
• Homeowner provides: Sweat equity + good faith effort
• Credit union finances: 30-year mortgage @ 5.8% fixed rate
• Monthly payment: ~$550-$700 (depending on location & price)

HOW DOES IT STAY AFFORDABLE?
• Community Land Trusts hold the land (permanent affordability)
• Resale formula: (Original Price × inflation) + (40% of appreciation)
  → This means future buyers pay below-market rates
• 30-year affordability covenant recorded on deed
• Right-of-First-Refusal: CLT can buy property back if family moves

WHERE CAN I BUY?
12 NYC neighborhoods with existing Community Land Trusts:
  Harlem, East New York, Central Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens
  + 7 additional CLT service areas

TIMELINE
Year 1-3:  750 conversions/year
Year 4-7:  1,250 conversions/year
Year 8-10: 1,700 conversions/year
GOAL:      5,600 homeowners by 2035

WHO RUNS THIS?
• NYC Department of Housing & Community Development (HPD)
  → New Public Equity Transfer Office (PETO)
• Community Land Trusts
  → Land ownership; affordability enforcement
• Local Credit Unions
  → Mortgage financing; member support
• NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA)
  → Subsidy coordination; income verification

WHAT IF I CAN'T PAY MY MORTGAGE?
• 120-day forbearance period (no foreclosure)
• Loan modifications available
• Deed-in-lieu options (return home to CLT; no foreclosure)
• Right-to-remain-renting: Can stay in home as market-rate tenant

HOW MUCH WEALTH DO I BUILD?
Average homeowner equity: $102,000 over 10 years
Example: Buy home for $425K → Home appreciates to $550K
  Your equity: $125K (down payment + appreciation + mortgage paydown)
  You keep: ~$75K (CLT recaptures excess appreciation)
  Your net wealth: $102K+ (intergenerational asset)

FAIR HOUSING & CIVIL RIGHTS
• No discrimination (protected classes: race, color, religion, sex, 
  disability, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, 
  gender identity)
• Language access: Applications, counseling, legal docs in 15+ languages
• Legal representation: Right-to-counsel for any foreclosure dispute
• Annual equity audit: Program outcome reviewed for racial equity impacts

COST TO CITY
• 10-year investment: $973 million
• Revenue recapture (property tax): $396 million
• Net cost: $577 million over 10 years ($58M/year)
• ROI: 1.296x (city gets back $1.30 for every $1 invested)

BOTTOM LINE
✓ Low-income families build permanent wealth
✓ Racial equity: 40% BIPOC beneficiaries
✓ Neighborhoods stabilized: CLTs keep properties affordable forever
✓ City gets fiscal return on subsidy investment
✓ No new money needed: Uses existing budget

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MEMORANDUM

TO:         New York City Council Members
FROM:       [Introducing Council Member Name]
            Housing & Community Development Committee
DATE:       December 30, 2025
RE:         INTRODUCTION A-[XXXX]: Public Equity Transfer Act
            —Restructuring NYC Housing Subsidies into Tenant 
             Ownership

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PURPOSE

This memo introduces INT A-XXXX: Public Equity Transfer Act—
comprehensive legislation to convert $680 million in annual 
NYC housing subsidies into a tenant ownership framework that 
generates wealth-building, racial equity, and municipal fiscal 
returns.

THE PROBLEM

NYC spends $680M annually on housing subsidies (HPD, HRA, NYCHA) 
with no mechanism for beneficiaries to build equity. After 20+ 
years in subsidized housing, renters accumulate zero assets. 
This perpetuates the racial wealth gap: white families hold 10x 
more home equity than Black families nationally.

Current subsidy system:
• $680M/year spent
• Zero equity creation for renters
• High turnover (families cycle through programs)
• No intergenerational asset transfer
• Fiscal ROI: 0.0x (pure expense, no revenue recapture)

THE SOLUTION

The Public Equity Transfer (PET) Act restructures subsidies into 
ownership via:
  1. Community Land Trusts (land ownership; permanent affordability)
  2. Credit unions (mortgage financing; member support)
  3. HPD (Public Equity Transfer Office for program administration)

Eligible families (up to 120% AMI) can convert portion of subsidy 
into down payment assistance ($85K average, 20% of home price) 
and secure 30-year mortgage from credit union partner.

FISCAL MODEL (10-Year Base Case)

Investment:
  City subsidy reallocation ........... $680M
  Down payment assistance ............. $255M
  CLT grants + PETO ops ............... $37.8M
  Total city investment ............... $973M

Revenue:
  Property tax increment (10-yr) ...... $133.4M
  Subsidy savings (S8 recapture, etc) . $262.6M
  Total revenue ....................... $396M

NET COST: $577M over 10 years ($57.7M/year average)
MUNICIPAL ROI: 1.296x ($1.30 recovered per $1 invested)

EQUITY OUTCOMES (Year 10)

  5,600 households transition to ownership
  $138.8M in homeowner equity created ($102K average per household)
  $197.4M in CLT community wealth accumulated
  $572.6M in total intergenerational wealth transfer
  
  Demographics:
  • 40% BIPOC beneficiaries (meets policy target)
  • 46% low-moderate income households (50-80% AMI)
  • 35% single-parent households
  • Geographic distribution: All 5 boroughs

CREDIT UNION & CLT PARTNERSHIPS

12 NYC Community Land Trusts ready to implement:
  Harlem CLT, East New York CLT, Central Brooklyn CLT, 
  Bronx CLT, Queens CLT + 7 others

15+ mission-driven credit unions certified for program:
  Combination of NYC-based CUs + national networks (CUNA members)

Funding commitment: $22.8M over 10 years for CLT operations grants
Underwriting standards: Credit scores as low as 580; non-traditional 
                       credit accepted; flexible income verification

SAFEGUARDS

  ✓ 30-year affordability covenants recorded on all deeds
  ✓ Right-of-First-Refusal: CLTs can purchase on resale
  ✓ Resale formula caps appreciation; excess retained by CLT
  ✓ 120-day forbearance for borrowers in financial hardship
  ✓ Annual equity reporting disaggregated by race, income, borough
  ✓ Civil rights compliance: Fair Housing, Section 504, Title VI
  ✓ 10-year sunset (Dec 31, 2035) with mandatory reauthorization

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

Phase I (Years 1-3): 750 conversions/year; partner recruitment; 
                     subsidy identification
Phase II (Years 4-7): 1,250 conversions/year; scaled capacity; 
                      performance optimization
Phase III (Years 8-10): 1,700 conversions/year; system mature; 
                        replication readiness

KEY BENEFITS

For Families:
  • Build permanent wealth ($102K average equity per household)
  • Intergenerational asset transfer ($572.6M total)
  • Stable housing security (30-year affordability guarantee)
  • Path out of poverty through home equity

For Neighborhoods:
  • Community stabilization (CLTs prevent displacement)
  • Small business growth (homeownership increases local spending)
  • Community wealth concentration ($197.4M in CLT assets)

For Fiscal Bottom Line:
  • 1.296x municipal ROI (city recovers investment via tax revenue)
  • Subsidy reallocation (no new money required; redeployment only)
  • Property tax recovery ($133.4M over 10 years)
  • Sustainable model (proven in 12 NYC neighborhoods)

RISKS & MITIGATIONS

Risk: Economic downturn → default spike
Mitigation: $50M loss reserve fund; CU forbearance protocols

Risk: Low enrollment/uptake
Mitigation: Targeted outreach; enhanced pre-purchase counseling; 
          marketing campaign

Risk: CLT capacity constraints
Mitigation: Phased scale-up; partner training; performance grants 
           tied to expansion milestones

Risk: Gentrification/displacement pressure
Mitigation: CLT right-of-first-refusal; affordability covenant 
           permanence; community wealth retention

COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES

  Subsidy cost: $6.8B over 10 years
  Wealth created: $0
  ROI: 0.0x
  Equity impact: Negative (perpetuates wealth gap)

Alternative 1 (Increase Rental Subsidies):
  Cost: $9.0B–$10B over 10 years

  ROI: 0.0x
  Drawback: No asset building; perpetuates rent dependency

Alternative 2 (Mixed-Income Development):

  Affordable units created: ~500 (at 50% affordability)
  ROI: Negative (requires ongoing operating subsidy)
  Drawback: Private developer dependency; insufficient scale

Public Equity Transfer Act (Proposed):
  Cost: $973M for 5,600 conversions
  Wealth created: $572.6M
  ROI: 1.296x (positive fiscal return)
  Benefit: Immediate conversion of existing residents; permanent
