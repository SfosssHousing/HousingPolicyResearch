## PART 7: COUNCIL MEMBER INTRODUCTION TALKING POINTS

**(Use for press release, legislative memo, public statements)**

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"Today, I'm introducing the Public Equity Transfer Act—a landmark legislation that transforms New York City's $680 million annual housing subsidy into tenant ownership. This bill will allow 5,600 low-income New York families to build permanent wealth through homeownership, with $572 million in intergenerational assets created over 10 years. The PET Act restructures existing city subsidies into a fiscally sustainable, equity-centered framework that generates a 1.3x municipal return on investment while maintaining deep affordability through Community Land Trusts."

### 2-Minute Summary

"The housing crisis in New York City is both a fiscal and moral crisis. Families spend 50–60% of income on rent. Traditional subsidies trap people in poverty without building wealth. Meanwhile, the city spends nearly $700 million annually on rental assistance with no assets created.

The Public Equity Transfer Act reimagines housing subsidy as **equity investment**. Instead of renting forever, eligible families—those earning up to 120% AMI—can use a portion of their subsidy as a down payment toward homeownership. The city funds this transition through a Public Equity Transfer Office, partnering with Community Land Trusts (which maintain affordability) and credit unions (which finance the mortgages).

The results:

- **5,600 families** transition to ownership by 2035
- **$572.6 million** in cumulative wealth created (average $102K per household)
- **$197 million** in community assets retained by CLTs
- **1.296x municipal ROI** (city recovers more via property tax than it invests)
- **Racial equity gains**: 40% of beneficiaries are BIPOC families, addressing the 10x homeownership wealth gap

This is not a new entitlement. We're redeploying existing subsidies more efficiently. It's a tested model—Community Land Trusts operate successfully in 12 NYC neighborhoods already. Credit unions have deep expertise in affordable lending. What we're doing is connecting these dots and scaling what works."

### Legislative Impact Statement

"INT A-XXXX will:

1. Create the Public Equity Transfer (PET) Framework in NYC Administrative Code Title 26
1. Establish the Public Equity Transfer Office (PETO) within HPD with dedicated staffing
1. Authorize reallocation of $680M in existing subsidies across HPD, HRA, and NYCHA
1. Mandate partnership with Community Land Trusts and credit unions for program implementation
1. Establish equity reporting requirements (disaggregated by race, income, borough, family type)
1. Include a 10-year sunset (Dec 31, 2035) with mandatory reauthorization review"
