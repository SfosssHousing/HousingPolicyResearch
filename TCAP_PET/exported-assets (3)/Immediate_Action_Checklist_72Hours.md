## EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Bill text has typo/error

**Solution**:

1. Fix typo in DOCX
1. Resave as: NYC_Public_Equity_Transfer_Act_v1.1.docx
1. Re-export to PDF
1. Contact Council Clerk: "We're submitting revised PDF per earlier submission"
1. Provide updated PDF

### Problem: Printing service delays

**Solution**:

1. Contact DCAS or alternative print shop immediately
1. Explain deadline: "Legislation needs to be submitted to NYC Council by \[DATE\]"
1. Ask about rush production (usually available for 20-30% surcharge)
1. Have backup plan: Can 50 copies be ready faster? (Half for immediate delivery, half follow-up)

### Problem: Council Clerk says format doesn't comply

**Solution**:

1. Ask specifically: "Which formatting requirement was missed?"
1. Refer to: NYC Charter §74-101, City Council Rules Chapter 3.0
1. Use NYC_Council_Legislative_Format_Guide.md to identify issue

1. Emphasize: "We need your input and endorsement for committee hearing"
1. Offer in-person briefing meetings
1. Highlight: Specific benefits for each partner category
1. Set 2-week follow-up deadline for feedback
