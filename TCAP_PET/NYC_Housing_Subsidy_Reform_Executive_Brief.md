# NYC PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER ACT
## LEGISLATIVE SUMMARY & EXECUTIVE BRIEF
**Final Draft | December 30, 2025**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The **Public Equity Transfer (PET) Act** is a comprehensive NYC municipal law that restructures $680 million in annual housing subsidies from traditional rental assistance into **tenant-owned housing**, mediated through **Community Land Trusts (CLTs)**, financed by **mission-driven credit unions**, and tracked through disaggregated equity metrics.

Over 10 years (2026–2035):
- **5,600 eligible households** convert from rent subsidies to homeownership
- **$572.6M in intergenerational wealth** accrues to BIPOC and low-income families
- **$197.4M in community wealth** captured by CLTs for perpetual affordability
- **$133.4M in property tax revenue** recovers to municipal coffers
- **1.296x municipal ROI** on initial $680M investment (plus $680M federal/private leverage)

---

## LEGISLATIVE INTENT & FINDINGS

### Core Problem Statement
NYC spends **$2.1 billion annually** on housing subsidies (HPD, HRA, NYCHA, Section 8) yet:
- Produces no homeowner equity for beneficiaries
- Creates intergenerational poverty traps
- Generates zero municipal wealth recapture
- Excludes 40%+ BIPOC and low-income households from ownership pathways

### Solution Framework
Reallocate existing subsidy budgets into **equity investments** that:
1. Convert eligible tenants to homeowners with permanent affordability
2. Channel credit union financing to underserved borrowers
3. Deploy CLT ground leases to cap speculation and preserve equity
4. Track outcomes by race, income, family type, tenure, borough
5. Recapture subsidy dollars as property tax revenue + municipal wealth

### Key Policy Innovations
- **Subsidy Reallocation** (not new spending): Tier subsidy conversion across HPD, HRA, NYCHA
- **Intergenerational Focus**: Measure wealth transfer at 5/10/20/30-year milestones
- **Equity Gatekeeping**: 40% BIPOC target, 15% very-low-income minimum
- **CLT Integration**: 12 existing NYC CLTs + new partnership grants
- **Credit Union Partnership**: 30-year fixed @ 5.5–6.8%, 100% LTV for share loans

---

## LEGISLATIVE STRUCTURE (Sections 1–15)

### Section 1: Short Title & Findings
- Legislative findings on subsidy inefficiency, wealth gap, CLT efficacy
- Legislative intent: "equity investment" reframing

### Section 2: Definitions
- **Public Equity Transfer Framework**: Defined as subsidy-to-ownership conversion model
- **Eligible Household**: Income ≤120% AMI, 12-month rent payment history
- **Community Land Trust**: Nonprofit holding title to land, leasing to homeowners
- **Affordability Covenant**: 30+ year resale restriction per formula
- **Intergenerational Wealth Metric**: Measured at homeowner level; reported disaggregated

### Section 3: Department Responsibilities & PETO Governance
- HPD creates **Public Equity Transfer Office (PETO)** within existing structure
- PETO Director reports to Commissioner
- PETO coordinates across HPD, HRA, NYCHA, DCP, DOF

### Section 4: Subsidy Reallocation & Financial Mechanics
- **Total Reallocation**: $680M over 10 years
- **Source**: HPD capital reallocation ($300M) + HRA subsidy conversion ($200M) + NYCHA PACT savings ($180M)
- **Uses**: Down payment assistance (20% per HH), CLT grants, CU partner training, legal/counseling

### Section 5: Three Tiered Ownership Pathways
1. **Limited-Equity Cooperative (LEC) via CLT**: Share buydown via credit union; cooperative board governance
2. **CLT Ground Lease Homeownership**: Fee-simple home ownership on CLT-held land; resale formula capped appreciation
3. **Conventional Covenant-Secured Ownership**: Standard mortgage on CLT-held property; 30-year affordability deed lien

### Section 6: Affordability Covenants & Enforcement
- **Resale Formula**: [Original Price × (1 + CPI)^Years] + [40% × Appreciation Above CPI]
- **Right of First Refusal**: CLT has 30-day ROFR on all resales
- **Title Lien Recording**: Permanent affordability covenant recorded against deed
- **Equity Recapture**: Sales above formula price: 60% to CLT, 40% to seller

### Section 7: Credit Union Partnership Mechanism
- **Authorized Partners**: NCUA-chartered credit unions + mission-driven banks
- **Loan Products**: 30-year fixed @ 5.5–6.8%, 20-year @ 5.5–6.5%, share loans @ 100% LTV
- **Underwriting Standards**: Credit score 580+, non-traditional credit allowed
- **Default Mitigation**: 120-day forbearance, loan modification, deed-in-lieu options

### Section 8: CLT Integration & Governance
- **12 Existing NYC CLT Partners**: Harlem CLT, East New York CLT, Brooklyn CLT, etc.
- **Annual Grant Structure**: $600K–$2M per CLT per year (10-year commitment = $11M–$18M per CLT)
- **Performance Gates**: 85%+ completion rate, <2% default, >85% member satisfaction
- **Equity Governance**: 50%+ board = current/former homeowners; 40%+ BIPOC

### Section 9: Implementation Timeline
- **Phase I (Yr 1–3)**: 750 conversions/year; HPD subsidy identification; CU partner recruitment
- **Phase II (Yr 4–7)**: 1,250 conversions/year; scaled CLT capacity; state supplemental funding
- **Phase III (Yr 8–10)**: 1,700 conversions/year; replication model; system optimization

### Section 10: Equity Accountability & Disaggregated Reporting
- **Annual Report**: Race/ethnicity, income, family type, borough, tenure
- **Year 10 Equity Targets**: 40% households of color, 15% very-low-income
- **Intergenerational Wealth Tracking**: Per-household wealth accrual at 5/10/20/30 years

By redeploying existing $680M in annual subsidies through CLTs and credit unions, NYC can:
- Convert 5,600+ eligible households to homeowners
- Build $572.6M in intergenerational family wealth
- Capture $197.4M in community assets via CLTs
- Generate $133.4M in new property tax revenue
- Achieve 1.296x fiscal ROI
- Advance racial and income equity in homeownership

The Act's design prioritizes **intergenerational equity**, **community wealth-building**, **permanent affordability**, and **fiscal sustainability**—aligning NYC's housing subsidy system with 21st-century values of asset-building and economic justice.
