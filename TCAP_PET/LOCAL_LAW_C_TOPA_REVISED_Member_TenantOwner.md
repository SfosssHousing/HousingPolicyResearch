# LOCAL LAW C: TENANT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE RIGHTS EXPANSION

## Revised with "Member (Tenant-Owner)" Terminology for Post-Acquisition

**Status:** Ready for NYC Council Introduction\
**Effective Date:** 120 days after enactment (aligns with Intro 902-A COPA)

______________________________________________________________________

## SECTION 1: LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT (§ 26-1901)

The City Council finds that:

(a) **Tenant Displacement Crisis:** Tenant displacement threatens housing stability and community cohesion across New York City, particularly in communities of color experiencing disproportionate gentrification;

(b) **Information Gaps:** Property sales and foreclosures frequently occur without tenant knowledge or meaningful input, limiting opportunities for tenant-led ownership and community wealth-building;

(c) **Ownership as Stabilization:** Granting tenants and tenant associations a right of first opportunity to purchase their buildings promotes housing stability, wealth accumulation, democratic control, and prevents displacement;

(d) **Strengthening TOPA:** Tenant opportunity to purchase rights must be strengthened and integrated with the PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER FRAMEWORK (LOCAL LAW A) and TCAP (LOCAL LAW D) to facilitate member (tenant-owner) acquisition and cooperative conversion;

(e) **Community Wealth:** Tenant-led, member (tenant-owner)-controlled cooperatives create lasting community wealth and self-determination for renters otherwise excluded from homeownership.

______________________________________________________________________

## SECTION 2: DEFINITIONS (§ 26-1902)

Terms used in this chapter have the same meanings as in LOCAL LAW A (PUBLIC EQUITY TRANSFER FRAMEWORK), Chapter 18 (§ 26-1802). Additionally:

**"Bona Fide Offer"**: A written offer to purchase property containing specified price, payment terms, conditions, good-faith deposit, and evidencing a prospective purchaser ready, willing, and able to complete the transaction within stated timeline.

**"Notice of Sale"**: Written notification provided to tenants and relevant agencies informing them of the owner's intent to sell the property and tenants' rights under this chapter.

**"Tenant Association"**: Formal organization of tenants residing in an eligible property organized for the purpose of cooperative acquisition, per LOCAL LAW A § 26-1802.

**"Member (Tenant-Owner)"**: Upon acquisition and conversion to a cooperative, each person who purchases a share and occupies a dwelling unit shall be a member (tenant-owner), with full rights and obligations under LOCAL LAW A and this chapter.
