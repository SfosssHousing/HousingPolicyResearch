- Provide culturally specific financial literacy and homeownership education programs
- Offer language-accessible counseling in Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, Vietnamese
- Partner with minority-owned financial institutions as additional credit union partners

### TEMPLATE C-3: GROUND LEASE EXCERPT
### (For Limited-Equity Cooperative Properties)

#### PARTIES
- **Landlord/Ground Lessor:** [CLT NAME], a New York nonprofit corporation
- **Tenant/Lessee:** [HOMEOWNER], as member of [COOPERATIVE NAME], a housing cooperative incorporated in New York

#### TERM
- **Lease Period:** 99 years from date of execution, renewable at member option for additional 50-year period at no cost
- **Ground Rent:** $1/year (nominal); paid annually by Cooperative to CLT

#### COVENANT RESTRICTIONS ON SHARE RESALE

**"Resale of membership shares in the Cooperative shall be restricted as follows:**

1. **Affordability Price:** Any member wishing to resell their membership share must notify the Cooperative and CLT board in writing. The Cooperative shall appraise the property; CLT shall calculate resale price per the formula in Schedule A.

2. **Income Eligibility:** Prospective purchaser must have household income ≤120% Area Median Income (verified by CLT). If prospective buyer exceeds income threshold, Cooperative shall maintain property for next qualified buyer or offer to CLT for acquisition.

3. **Price Formula:**
   - **Indexed Approach (Preferred):** Resale Price = [Original Share Price × (1 + CPI)^(Years Owned)] + [40% × Home Appreciation Above CPI]
   - **Itemized Approach:** Original Price + actual documented improvements (pre-approved by CLT) + modest carry charges + CLT administration

4. **Right of First Refusal:** CLT has 30-day right to match any third-party offer above calculated resale price. If CLT exercises ROFR, it may retain property for future low-income sale or donate to another qualified household.

5. **Equity Recapture:** Any sale proceeds above the calculated affordability price shall be split: 40% to seller, 60% to CLT operating reserve and future membership education programming.

6. **Permitted Uses:** Membership shares may only be held by individuals who occupy the property as a primary residence. No investor/landlord ownership; subletting prohibited except with written CLT approval (rare exception for temporary relocation with return obligation).

7. **Enforcement:** CLT shall record this covenant as a restrictive covenant lien against the property deed. Violation of the resale formula does not void sale but triggers mandatory equity recapture by CLT."

## APPENDIX D: ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS

### D-1: HPD-Led Acquisition + CLT Mediation (Scenario A)

**Trigger:** For properties with existing HPD subsidy or acquired via tax foreclosure

**Process Flow:**
1. HPD identifies candidate property (multi-family rental, occupied)
2. HPD appraises and acquires building via capital funds or PACT
3. Transferring management to CLT; CLT offers homeownership to current tenants
4. Credit union finances individual share purchases (80% LTV on LEC share)
5. HPD provides down payment assistance ($85K/unit); CLT administers ground lease

**Advantages:** Fast execution; city controls property; CLT role focused on governance
**Disadvantages:** High upfront capital requirement; CLT may lack autonomy on property mgt; complex transfer mechanics
**Target Volume:** 800 conversions/year; 8,000 over 10 years

---

### D-2: HRA Subsidy Conversion (Scenario B)

**Trigger:** For rent-stabilized/HRA-assisted units with expiring subsidy

**Process Flow:**
1. Tenant identifies building on HRA lease expiration list
2. HRA provides subsidy buyout (lump sum = NPV of remaining subsidy)
3. Tenant uses buyout + HPD down payment assistance to purchase via credit union
4. Property enters CLT ground lease; affordability preserved 30+ years
5. HRA recovers subsidy funds for redeployment to next cohort

**Advantages:** Recycles subsidy dollars; enables HRA budget relief; fast tenant buy-ins
**Disadvantages:** Requires landlord cooperation (negotiation-heavy); HRA revenue loss impact
**Target Volume:** 600 conversions/year; 6,000 over 10 years

---

### D-3: NYCHA Resident Cooperatization (Scenario C)

**Trigger:** NYCHA RAD/PACT portfolio units reaching stable operation

**Process Flow:**
1. NYCHA residents vote (>75% approval) for cooperative conversion
2. HPD funds share acquisition for residents; credit union finances working capital
3. Cooperative board assumes property management; NYCHA transitions to landlord/monitor
4. Permanent affordability via cooperative bylaws + CLT ground lease
5. Resident equity accumulation via annual dividend distributions from co-op surplus

**Advantages:** Resident control; NYCHA capital liability transfer; community wealth-building
**Disadvantages:** Complex governance transition; training/capacity needs; legal precedent questions
**Target Volume:** 300-400 conversions/year; 3,500 over 10 years

---
