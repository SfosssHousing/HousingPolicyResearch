## TERMINOLOGY LOCKED & STANDARDIZED

**Throughout all 4 Local Laws + PART V:**

### Definition (Consistent Across All Documents)

> **"Member" or "Tenant-Owner"**: An individual shareholder in a limited-equity cooperative organized under NY Cooperative Law § 1801–2000 who:
> - Holds cooperative shares (ownership interest)
> - Occupies a dwelling unit (tenancy + residency)
> - Maintains non-forfeitable equity account (wealth-building)
> - Has voting power in governance (one vote per share = democratic control)
> - Subject to affordability covenant (30-year permanence + 15% income cap)

### Usage Pattern (Applied Uniformly)

**First Mention:** "Member (tenant-owner)" — introduces both terms  
**Subsequent:** "Member" or "tenant-owner" interchangeably  
**Community:** Emphasize "tenant-owner" (ownership signal)  
**Governance:** Use "board member" for standard org roles  
**Exceptions:** "Tenant" = non-owners; "tenant association" = pre-purchase entity

---

✅ **All Checks Passed:**

- [x] Terminology consistency across all 4 Local Laws + PART V
- [x] Legal soundness review (no conflicts, clear authority)
- [x] Cross-references verified (all internal links accurate)
