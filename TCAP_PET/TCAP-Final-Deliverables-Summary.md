## 🎤 TALKING POINTS SUMMARY

### **30-Second Pitch:**
"NYC spends $5 billion subsidizing landlord profits. Zero goes to tenant wealth. TCAP redirects those subsidies to cooperative ownership. Tenants accumulate $30K+ equity, control buildings, build wealth. DC did TOPA 40 years. SF did COPA 30 years. Now NYC leads. Co-sponsor INT. A-D."

### **2-Minute Explanation:**
"Current system: tenant pays rent, landlord extracts profit, city subsidizes gap, tenant builds zero wealth. Result: homeownership gap stays at 17-27 percentage points, evictions continue, displacement accelerates.

TCAP reimagines this: tenant subsidy becomes equity share. Instead of permanent renting, tenants own cooperative by year 5. Instead of evictions, tenants control governance. Instead of landlord extraction, resident wealth.

Precedent: DC TOPA (40 years), SF COPA (30 years)—both work. Fiscal: $2.90 return per $1 invested. Equity: 4-6 pp homeownership gap closure. Impact: 2,000 households, $64M wealth, $398M public savings.

NYC can lead nationally. This is fiscal responsibility + equity + democracy."

### **Key Statistics (Memorize These):**
- $5 billion annual subsidy budget
- 17-27 percentage point homeownership racial gap
- $32,000 average equity per household (Year 10)
- $398 million public savings (10-year)
- 2.9:1 return on investment
- 2,000 households served (Phase 1-5)
- 40-75% eviction reduction
- 40 years TOPA (DC), 30 years COPA (SF) precedent
