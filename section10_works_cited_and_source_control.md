# Section 10 — Works Cited and Source Control

This section contains the consolidated reference list in APA 7th edition format for all sources cited in the PET/TCAP master proposal, followed by a source-control protocol to keep the bibliography stable as the proposal evolves.

## 10.1 Works Cited (APA 7th)

Notes:

- Entries are listed as provided in the project library. Where an entry is missing a URL or publisher detail, treat it as a “metadata completion” task (fill via the primary source, not a secondary citation).
- If a source is used only in an appendix (e.g., legislative text excerpts), it remains listed here to preserve auditability.

**Reference List Compiled By:** Policy Research Documentation Services\
**APA Edition:** 7th Edition (2020)\
**Total Sources:** 50+ primary and secondary sources\
**Document Version:** October 25, 2025

## 10.2 Source Control Protocol

### A. Canonical bibliography file

Maintain **one** canonical bibliography and treat it as the source of truth:

- `Works_Cited_MASTER.md` (human-readable, APA formatted)
- `Works_Cited_MASTER.csv` (machine-readable fields for automation: author, year, title, publisher, url, access_date, notes, tags)

Every other artifact (one-pager, briefing memo, slide deck, legislative memos, toolkits) should reference this master list rather than maintaining separate bibliographies.

### B. Primary-source rule

When the proposal cites numbers, statutory text, or program parameters:

1. Prefer **primary sources** (statutes, agency reports, audited budget documents, HUD/NYC DSS/HPD program documents).
1. If a secondary source is used for interpretation, cite **both**: the primary data source and the interpretive analysis.

### C. Citation integrity checks (required before “final” exports)

Before exporting the master report to PDF/Word:

- **In-text to bibliography check:** Every in-text citation must have a corresponding bibliography entry.
- **Bibliography to in-text check:** Remove any entry not used anywhere in the report (unless explicitly marked “background / future integration”).
- **Date sanity check:** Verify years, edition numbers, and “retrieved on” dates for online sources.
- **Numeric claim traceability:** For every numeric claim in the Executive Summary and Financial/ROI section, record the exact source and page/table reference in a footnote or endnote comment.

### D. Legislative drafting citations

For local laws and model legislation:

- Cite the **controlling authority** (NYC Admin Code, NYS Private Housing Finance Law, Cooperative Corporations Law, HUD guidance, NYDFS guidance).
- When modeling from another jurisdiction (e.g., DC TOPA), cite the statute and an authoritative explainer (government or legal aid publication) if needed.

### E. Update workflow (when adding new sources)

When a new source is added:

1. Add it to the master bibliography.
1. Add a 1–3 sentence annotation (what it supports, and which section it belongs to).
1. Tag it (examples): `ROI`, `CityFHEPS`, `TOPA`, `cooperatives`, `CLT`, `HDFCs`, `health impacts`, `education impacts`.
1. If it replaces an older source for the same claim, mark the older one as `superseded` rather than deleting immediately (keep a short deprecation log).

### F. Versioning

Use a date-stamped versioning convention for releases:

- `TCAP_PET_Master_Report_vYYYY-MM-DD.md`
- `Works_Cited_MASTER_vYYYY-MM-DD.md`

Keep a short change log at the top of the master bibliography (added sources, removed sources, corrected metadata).
