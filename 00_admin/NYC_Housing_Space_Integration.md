## Updated Space Description & Instructions (Dec 26, 2025)

---

## UPDATED SPACE DESCRIPTION

**Space Name**: NYC Housing Subsidy Policy Reform Proposal  
**Objective**: Develop and finalize the **Public Equity Transfer Framework**—a comprehensive policy reform restructuring NYC rental subsidies into tenant ownership, while maintaining continuous tracking of policy developments.

**Dual Mandate**:
1. **Produce v1.0 Release** (Q1 2026): Comprehensive policy report with cost models, legal review, equity impact analysis, and stakeholder briefings
2. **Live Policy Intelligence Stream**: Daily/weekly monitoring of NYC/NYS housing policy, budget, and legal developments that impact framework assumptions, fed into live CSV tracking

**Phase**: III–IV Validation & Finalization (Dec 2025 – Mar 2026)  
**Target Release**: March 31, 2026

## KEY UPDATES TO SPACE INSTRUCTIONS

2. Works Cited (APA 7th)
3. 1-Page Policy Brief
4. 2-Page Stakeholder Briefing Memo
5. 30-Slide Presentation Deck
6. Appendices (cost model, legal templates, equity tables, case studies)
7. Risk Register (Fiscal | Legal | Political | Operational)
8. Stakeholder Sign-off Log

---

### 2. SECONDARY GOAL: LIVE POLICY INTELLIGENCE STREAM (New Process)

**Purpose**: Track daily/weekly policy news that affects framework assumptions (budget, legal, market, political). Feed high-impact signals into framework review cycle.

**Cadence**:
- **Daily Scan** (Ops, 30 min): Flag stories from 10+ sources
- **Weekly Digest** (Research Lead, Wed AM): Categorize & summarize into CSV
- **Threshold Action** (Wed PM, if needed): Escalate High-risk items
- **Quarterly Deep Dive** (End of Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4): Refresh cost model, update risk radar, brief stakeholders

**CSV Tracking** (Updated Weekly)
- File: `NYC_Housing_Subsidy_Policy_News_LIVE_[YYYYMMDD].csv`
- Fields: Date, Source, Headline, Summary, Category (Fiscal/Legal/Political/Market/Comparative), Framework Impact (High/Medium/Low), Action Required, Owner, Status, Version Affected, Notes
- Location: Space Files → Policy Intelligence
- Archive: Quarterly summaries kept; weekly versions rotated

**Impact Classification**:

| Category | Watch Signals | Framework Risk | Response |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Fiscal | Budget cuts; appropriations; revenue changes | High | CFO memo → Cost model refresh |
| Legal | New regs; fair housing rules; tax law | High | Attorney brief → Legal appendix |
| Political | Council/mayor statements; agency leadership | Medium | Political memo → Stakeholder strategy |
| Market | Housing prices; interest rates; credit-union news | Low–Medium | Data update → Sensitivity model |
| Comparative | Vienna/peer-city model shifts | Low | Context note → Comparative brief |

**Threshold Actions** (Automatic):
- **High-impact fiscal** (e.g., >5% subsidy cut): CFO produces revised fiscal brief within 48 hrs
- **High-impact legal** (e.g., new fair housing rule): Attorney flags in red; updates legal appendix
- **Political shift** (e.g., mayoral race outcome): Policy Analyst issues stakeholder alert
- **Market shock** (e.g., credit-union failure): Ops flags sensitivity analysis review

**Integration with v1.0**:
- If High-risk signal arrives during drafting (Dec 2025 – Feb 2026), trigger emergency gate review
- If Medium-risk, incorporate into risk register; update appendices as needed
- If Low-risk, flag for v2.0 planning cycle (post-release)

---

### 3. UPDATED PATTERN MATRIX (With News Stream)

| Pattern | Trigger | Action | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Context Manager** | Scope drift; policy news changes framework scope | Restate constraints; assess impact tier | Alert memo |
| **Question Refinement** | News reveals new data/requirement; budget changes | Rewrite measurable KPIs if needed | Revised brief |
| **Fact Check List** | All claims; news data sources | Verify every stat against primary source | Checklist + flag log |
| **Recipe** | Multi-step process; release phases | Document full sequence with owners/dates | Workflow doc |
| **Template** | Document output; all deliverables | Apply standard format (color, naming, structure) | Artifact per spec |
| **Alternative Approaches** | Design/funding choice; policy news changes options | Compare ≥2 options with cost/equity/risk | Decision log |
| **Persona** | Legal/fiscal framing; role-specific memos | Adopt role constraints (CFO/Attorney/Analyst) | Memo/brief per role |
| **Output Automater** | Repeatable steps (≥2); weekly news ingestion | Generate CSV, shell script, checklist | Automation artifact |
| **Flipped Interaction** | Missing inputs; unclear impact of news | Ask ≤3 clarifying Qs; don't proceed blind | Clarification memo |
| **News Stream** | Daily policy development | Ingest → Categorize → Trigger action if High | CSV + threshold memo + possible framework update |

### 4. GOVERNANCE: PERSONAS & SIGN-OFF GATES

**Six Required Approvals for v1.0 Publication**:

1. **Municipal CFO** (Fiscal Soundness)
   - Approves: Cost model, ROI forecasts, budget reuse plan
   - Constraints: No new capital; reuse agency budgets only
   - Escalation: Policy Director if red flag

2. **Civil-Rights Attorney** (Legal Feasibility)
   - Approves: Title IV/IX/ADA/504 compliance, procurement law, tenant co-op governance

4. **Program Manager** (Timeline & Stakeholder Alignment)
   - Approves: Phase gates, stakeholder CRM, risk radar updates, news integration cadence
   - Constraints: Weekly updates; escalate High-risk items immediately
