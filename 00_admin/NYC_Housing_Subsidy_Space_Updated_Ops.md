**Current Release Target**: Q1 2026

______________________________________________________________________

## SPACE OBJECTIVE

**Secondary Capability**: Continuous **live policy intelligence stream** tracking daily developments impacting the framework, feeding into quarterly briefing updates and stakeholder alerts.

______________________________________________________________________

## SCOPE & BOUNDARIES

### Geographic

- **Primary**: NYC agencies (HPD, HRA, NYCHA)
- **Secondary**: NYS budget context (HCR, OSC)
- **Comparative**: HUD programs; international models (Vienna) flagged as context-only

### Fiscal

- Reuse existing agency subsidy budgets (no new capital requests unless tenants = direct investors)
- Credit-union partnerships for member equity and reserves
- ROI forecasted over 15-year tenant lifecycle

### Legal

- Title IV/IX/ADA/504 compliance mandatory
- Procurement law review required
- Waivers identified, not assumed

### Language & Framing

- **Equity Investment**, not "subsidy" or "welfare"
- **Public Equity Transfer**, not "privatization"
- **Tenant Co-Owner**, not "beneficiary"
