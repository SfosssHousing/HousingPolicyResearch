### Key Questions to Answer (By Feb 7)

1. **Budget Reuse Feasibility**: Which existing HPD/HRA/NYCHA subsidy streams can be redirected to tenant equity (without new capital)?
   - [ ] HPD rental assistance → Tenant equity investment?
   - [ ] HRA supportive housing → Tenant equity investment?
   - [ ] NYCHA preservation → Tenant equity investment?
   - [ ] Legal constraints? Agency approval required?

2. **ROI Projection**: What is the 15-year break-even for tenant co-ownership (in net wealth gain)?
   - [ ] 5-year recovery? 10-year? 15-year?
   - [ ] Sensitivity: What if rents rise 3%/year? 5%/year?
   - [ ] Sensitivity: What if interest rates rise 1%? 2%?

3. **Credit-Union Reserves**: How much capital do credit unions need to hold for member equity + loan defaults?
   - [ ] Standard 2:1 loan-to-reserve ratio?
   - [ ] Tenant co-op risk premium?
   - [ ] Available capital from current CU balance sheets?

4. **Intergenerational Wealth**: How much net wealth accumulates for tenant over 15 years?
   - [ ] Average wealth gain per household?
   - [ ] Disaggregated by income tier (0–30% AMI, 30–60%, 60–100%)?
   - [ ] Impact on homeownership pathway?

### Red Flags to Avoid

🚩 **Do NOT** propose new city capital; must reuse agency budgets only  
🚩 **Do NOT** assume credit-union willingness without written commitment (MOU)  
🚩 **Do NOT** ignore interest-rate sensitivity; include ±2% scenarios  
🚩 **Do NOT** hide budget reuse constraints; flag all legal/procedural barriers  
🚩 **Do NOT** project ROI without equity disaggregation (wealth by race/income)  

### Emergency Protocol: High-Risk Fiscal News

**If Research Lead flags HIGH-RISK fiscal story** (e.g., mayoral announcement of >5% HPD subsidy cut):
1. You receive alert by Wed 11 AM
2. By Wed 3 PM: Produce 1-page memo assessing impact
   - [ ] Which cost model assumptions affected?
   - [ ] Does v1.0 release still viable? Why/why not?
   - [ ] What mitigation options?
3. By Thu 10 AM: Brief Program Manager + Policy Director
4. Trigger emergency Phase III gate review if v1.0 viability threatened
5. Update risk register; mark version affected

**If Medium-risk fiscal signal** (e.g., interest rates rise 0.5%):
- [ ] Flag for sensitivity model review (monthly)
- [ ] Include in quarterly deep dive
- [ ] No immediate v1.0 update unless cumulative impact >5% ROI change

🚩 **Do NOT** ignore procurement constraints; get corporation counsel sign-off on budget redirection
