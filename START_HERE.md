## 🗑️ Checklists

### Before You Start

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] npm is up to date (`npm --version`)
- [ ] Backend API endpoints ready
- [ ] Backend API URL known

### Setup

- [ ] Create package.json (from PACKAGE_JSON_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Run `npm run build` (test compilation)
- [ ] Configure backend URL in Raycast
- [ ] Build extension: `npm run build`
- [ ] Load into Raycast: `Cmd + Shift + A`

### Testing

- [ ] "Sweep Bills" command appears in search
- [ ] "Generate Draft" command appears
- [ ] "Add Source" command appears
- [ ] Select jurisdiction and sweep bills
- [ ] Enter section name and generate draft
- [ ] Add a test source with valid URL
- [ ] All three commands work without errors

### Troubleshooting

- [ ] "Backend URL not configured" → Set in Raycast preferences
- [ ] "Network error" → Check backend is running and URL is correct
- [ ] "404 error" → Verify endpoints exist (/sweep_bills, /generate_section, /add_source)
- [ ] TypeScript errors → Run `npm install` and `npm run typecheck`

---

## 📆 Backend API Requirements

Your backend must implement these three endpoints:

### 1. POST /sweep_bills
```
Request:  {jurisdictions: ["NYC"], since: "2024-12-01"}
Response: {items: [{title, jurisdiction, status, last_action}]}
```

### 2. POST /generate_section
```
Request:  {section: "Introduction", prompt: "Write about..."}
Response: {content: "## Introduction\n\n..."}
```

### 3. POST /add_source
```
Request:  {title: "NYC Housing Data", url: "https://...", notes: "..."}
Response: {success: true, id: "src_123"}
```

Detailed API specs: See **RAYCAST_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md**
