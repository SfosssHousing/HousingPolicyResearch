## Executive Summary

Provide a succinct overview of the problem, the recommended course of action
and the expected impact.  Decision‑makers often only read this section, so
write it clearly and persuasively.

## Background & Problem Statement

Describe the context of the issue.  Summarise existing research,
legislation and data relevant to the problem.  Use in‑text citations
like `[@smith_housing_2023]` to refer to items in your bibliography.  These
citations will be formatted according to APA 7 style when you render the
document.

## Policy Options

Outline at least three possible policy interventions.  For each option,
explain its mechanism, cost, equity implications, feasibility and risks.

## Recommendations

Select the preferred option(s) and justify your choice.  Explain how the
recommendation aligns with broader goals, addresses the problem and
mitigates potential harms.

## Implementation Considerations

Discuss how the recommended policy could be implemented, including
timelines, responsible agencies, necessary resources and potential legal
barriers.

## Conclusion

Summarise the key points and restate the recommendation.  End with a call
to action or a statement on next steps.

## References

The reference list will be automatically generated by Quarto based on the
cited works in the text.  Make sure that the `bibliography` field in the
metadata points to a `.bib` file exported from Zotero or another
reference manager.

## Appendix (optional)

Include tables, figures or supplementary analyses that support your brief.
