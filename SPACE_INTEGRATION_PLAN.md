## 4 | DETAILED RECIPES

### Recipe 1: Run Bill Sweep

**Goal:** Monitor new legislation across jurisdictions  
**Time:** 5 minutes per execution  
**Frequency:** Weekly (Mondays recommended)

**Step-by-step:**

```
STEP 1: Open Raycast (Cmd + Space)
STEP 2: Type "Sweep Bills"
STEP 3: Select the command
STEP 4: Check jurisdictions:
        ✓ NYC
        ✓ New York State
        (Optional: ✓ Federal)
STEP 5: Set "Search Since" date (e.g., 7 days ago)
STEP 6: Click "Sweep Bills"
STEP 7: Wait for results (5-30 seconds)
STEP 8: Review bills in detail view
STEP 9: Copy relevant bills to Notion database
STEP 10: Close Raycast (Esc)

OUTPUT: Array of bills with:
  - Title
  - Jurisdiction
  - Status
  - Last Action date
  - Summary (optional)
  - URL (optional)

NOT: Store results in CSV for weekly tracking
```

**Automation Hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# sweep_bills_weekly.sh
# Runs bill sweep every Monday at 9am

echo "Running weekly bill sweep..."
raycast sweep-bills --jurisdictions NYC,NY --since "7 days ago"
echo "Results exported to bills_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv"
```

### Recipe 2: Generate Policy Memo Section

**Goal:** Create draft policy memo sections with AI assistance  
**Time:** 2-5 minutes per section  
**Frequency:** As needed during drafting phase

**Step-by-step:**

```
STEP 1: Open Raycast (Cmd + Space)
STEP 2: Type "Generate Draft"
STEP 3: Select "Generate Draft Section" command
STEP 4: Enter Section Name (required)
        Examples:
        - "Executive Summary"
        - "Key Findings"
        - "Recommendations"
        - "Implementation Roadmap"
STEP 5: Enter Prompt (required)
        Example:
        "Summarize NYC housing subsidy reform findings from attached research, 
         focusing on ROI implications and equity outcomes. Target: 500 words."
STEP 6: Click "Generate Draft"
STEP 7: Wait for generation (10-60 seconds)
STEP 8: Review generated markdown in detail view
STEP 9: Copy/paste into policy memo document
STEP 10: Refine and edit as needed
STEP 11: Close Raycast (Esc)

OUTPUT: Markdown text with:
  - Section content
  - Metadata (tokens used, model, timestamp)
  - Ready for copy-paste into final document

NOTE: Output is draft only - human review required
```

**Automation Hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# draft_memo_section.sh
# Generates policy memo sections on demand

SECTION="$1"  # e.g., "Executive Summary"
PROMPT="$2"   # Detailed prompt

echo "Generating $SECTION draft..."
raycast generate-section --section "$SECTION" --prompt "$PROMPT"
echo "Draft generated - open memo document for refinement"
```

### Recipe 3: Add Research Source

**Goal:** Manage research source inventory  
**Time:** 1-2 minutes per source  
**Frequency:** As sources are discovered

**Step-by-step:**

```
STEP 1: Open Raycast (Cmd + Space)
STEP 2: Type "Add Source"
STEP 3: Select "Add Source" command
STEP 4: Enter Source Title (required)
        Example: "NYC Housing Preservation Database"
STEP 5: Enter URL (required)
        Format: https://example.com/resource
STEP 6: Enter Notes (optional)
        Example: "Key data on subsidy program outcomes, 
                  2015-2024 time series available"
STEP 7: Click "Add Source"
STEP 8: Confirm success notification
STEP 9: Source is now in Notion database
STEP 10: Close Raycast (Esc)

OUTPUT: Source stored with:
  - Title
  - URL (validated)
  - Notes
  - Timestamp
  - Source ID (for references)

INTEGRATION: Auto-tags source in Notion database
```

**Automation Hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# add_sources_batch.sh
# Batch add multiple sources from CSV

while IFS=',' read -r TITLE URL NOTES; do
  echo "Adding source: $TITLE"
  raycast add-source --title "$TITLE" --url "$URL" --notes "$NOTES"
done < sources.csv

echo "Batch source addition complete"
```

## 5 | OUTPUT AUTOMATION

### CSV Task List Generator

**Purpose:** Export Raycast operations to Notion/Trello task list

**Output Format:**

```csv
Task,Command,Owner,Due Date,Status,Priority,Artifact,Notes
Weekly Bill Sweep,sweep-bills,Policy Analyst,2025-01-06,TODO,HIGH,bills_20250106.csv,Monitor NYC/NY legislation
Draft Executive Summary,generate-section,Policy Analyst,2025-01-10,IN_PROGRESS,HIGH,memo_v1.md,Use bill sweep results as context
Add Housing Database Source,add-source,Policy Analyst,2025-01-06,DONE,MEDIUM,sources.csv,Key 2015-2024 data
Review Generated Section,Manual Review,Policy Analyst,2025-01-11,TODO,HIGH,memo_v1_reviewed.md,Edit and refine AI output
Finalize Memo,Manual Refinement,Policy Analyst,2025-01-15,TODO,HIGH,memo_final.docx,Integrate all sections
```

**Generation Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# generate_task_list.sh
# Creates task list from Raycast operations

echo "Task,Command,Owner,Due Date,Status,Priority,Artifact,Notes" > tasks.csv

# Bill sweep task
echo "Weekly Bill Sweep,sweep-bills,Policy Analyst,$(date -d '7 days' +%Y-%m-%d),TODO,HIGH,bills_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv,Monitor NYC/NY/Federal legislation" >> tasks.csv

# Draft task
echo "Draft Policy Memo Sections,generate-section,Policy Analyst,$(date -d '14 days' +%Y-%m-%d),TODO,HIGH,memo_v1.md,Use AI-assisted drafting" >> tasks.csv

# Source management task
echo "Maintain Source Inventory,add-source,Policy Analyst,ONGOING,IN_PROGRESS,MEDIUM,sources.csv,Add sources as discovered" >> tasks.csv

echo "Task list generated: tasks.csv"
```

### Fact Check List Automation

**Purpose:** Verify claims and sources in generated content

**Template:**

```
Claim: [From generated memo section]
Source: [Cited source or data point]
Verification Method: [Search, calculation, interview]
Status: [VERIFIED, NEEDS REVIEW, UNVERIFIED]
Notes: [Evidence or explanation]

Example:
Claim: NYC housing subsidy spending has increased 15% since 2020
Source: NYC HPD budget reports 2020-2024
Verification: Cross-check with municipal budget database
Status: NEEDS_REVIEW
Notes: Confirm inflation adjustment applied
```

## 7 | WORKFLOW EXECUTION

### Standard Workflow Loop

```
1. INTAKE (Monday)
   → Run BillSweep for NYC, NY, Federal jurisdictions
   → Export results to CSV (bills_[date].csv)
   → Review bills for housing subsidy relevance
   → Tag relevant bills in Notion

2. RESEARCH (Tue-Wed)
   → Add new sources as discovered (AddSource)
   → Tag sources by policy area
   → Store URLs and summaries in Notion database

3. DRAFTING (Wed-Thu)
   → Use DraftSection to generate memo sections
   → Input: Bill sweep results + source summaries
   → Output: Draft memo with Executive Summary, Key Findings
   → Manual refinement of AI output

4. VALIDATION (Thu-Fri)
   → Fact-check generated claims
   → Cross-reference with source documents
   → Update memo with verified information
   → Prepare final briefing memo

5. APPROVAL (Friday EOD)
   → Stakeholder review of final memo
   → Incorporate feedback
   → Export to DOCX/PDF for distribution
   → Archive in Git with version tag
```

### Escalation Gates

```
GATE 1: Bill Sweep Results
  IF no relevant bills → Continue monitoring
  IF relevant bills found → Proceed to Research

GATE 2: Source Quality
  IF sources are academic/government → Use as-is
  IF sources are advocacy → Note bias in memo
  IF missing critical sources → Manual research task

GATE 3: Generated Content Quality
  IF accuracy > 90% → Proceed to Validation
  IF accuracy < 90% → Return to DraftSection with refined prompt
  IF scope issue → Question Refinement pattern

GATE 4: Fact Check
  IF all claims verified → Proceed to Approval
  IF claims need revision → Update generated content
  IF claims unverifiable → Flag for stakeholder review

GATE 5: Final Approval
  IF approved → Export and archive
  IF revision needed → Return to Drafting
  IF reject → Question Refinement for next iteration
```
