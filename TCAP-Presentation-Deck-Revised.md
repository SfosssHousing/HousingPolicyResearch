# SLIDE 1: THE CRISIS WE FACE

## New York City's Housing Subsidy System is Broken

### The Numbers
- **$5+ billion annually** in rental assistance (CityFHEPS, Section 8, other programs)
- **Over 100,000 households** receiving vouchers remain perpetual renters
- **$45,000 per family per year** (city share) spent on emergency shelter
- **895,457 housing code violations** in FY2024 alone

### The Fundamental Problem
**Subsidies enrich landlords, not tenants**
- No wealth accumulation for recipients
- No pathway to ownership
- Perpetuates intergenerational inequality
- Reinforces racial wealth gaps

---

# SLIDE 2: THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP

## Homeownership Disparities Persist (2021-2022)

[68]

### Key Statistics
- **White households:** 44% homeownership
- **Black households:** 27% homeownership **(17-point gap)**
- **Latino households:** 17% homeownership **(27-point gap)**

### Why This Matters
- Homeownership = primary wealth-building tool for American families
- Racial gaps driven by structural exclusion, not individual factors
- Current subsidy system does NOTHING to address this

---

# SLIDE 3: OUR SOLUTION - TCAP

## Convert Rental Subsidies into Cooperative Equity

### The TCAP Model
1. **Tenant associations organize** to purchase their buildings
2. **Rental subsidies redirect** from rent payments to equity building
3. **Collective ownership** replaces landlord-tenant dynamic
4. **Affordability preserved** through 30+ year covenants

### Core Innovation
**Transform consumption subsidies into capital investments**
- Same public dollars, dramatically different outcomes
- Tenants become owners with democratic control
- Permanent affordability instead of temporary assistance

---

# SLIDE 4: HOW TCAP WORKS

## Four-Phase Conversion Process

### Phase 1: Organizing (Year 0)
- Tenants form association and elect leadership
- Partner with technical assistance provider
- Develop bylaws and governance structure
- Conduct feasibility analysis

### Phase 2: Acquisition (Year 1)
- Secure financing from Tenant Opportunity Fund
- Complete property inspections and due diligence
- Close on purchase and transfer title to cooperative
- Incorporate as Subsidized Limited-Equity Cooperative

### Phase 3: Transition (Years 2-3)
- Subsidies phase into equity allocation (50% → 65% → 75%)
- Intensive governance and financial management training
- Establish reserves and capital improvement planning
- HPD compliance monitoring and support

### Phase 4: Independence (Years 4-5+)
- Cooperative operates under own governance
- Annual reporting and performance monitoring
- Ongoing technical assistance available
- Full democratic control by member-owners

# SLIDE 5: THE FINANCIAL CASE

## REVISED Annual Cost Comparison (Per Unit)

[97]

### Status Quo: $33,900/year
- Voucher payment: $22,000
- Eviction/court costs: $5,400
- Emergency shelter risk: $4,500
- Administrative overhead: $2,000

### TCAP Model: $17,400/year
- Phased subsidy allocation: $18,000
- Technical assistance: $1,200
- Compliance monitoring: $800
- Administrative overhead: $1,200
- **LESS eviction cost savings: -$3,800**

### **Annual Savings: $16,500 per unit**

# SLIDE 7: WEALTH BUILDING IMPACT

## Creating Permanent Assets for Families

### Household Equity Accumulation

# SLIDE 8: CLOSING THE GAP

## Reducing Racial Homeownership Disparities

### Current Gap (2021-2022)
- Black: **17 points below** White homeownership
- Latino: **27 points below** White homeownership

### TCAP Impact (10-Year Projection)
- **2,000 new Black and Latino homeowners**
- **4-6 percentage point reduction** in gap
- **12-15% progress** toward gap closure

### Beyond Numbers
- Structural intervention addressing historical redlining

# SLIDE 9: HOUSING STABILITY OUTCOMES

## From Precarity to Permanence

### Eviction Reduction
- **Baseline:** 10-15% annual eviction filing rate
- **TCAP:** 2-4% eviction rate by Year 5
- **Result:** 60-75% reduction in evictions

### Residential Tenure
- **Baseline:** 3-5 years average occupancy
- **TCAP:** 12-15+ years average occupancy
- **Result:** Dramatic reduction in displacement

### Housing Cost Burden
- **Baseline:** 50-60% of income on housing
- **TCAP:** 25-35% of income by Year 5
- **Result:** Improved financial stability and quality of life
