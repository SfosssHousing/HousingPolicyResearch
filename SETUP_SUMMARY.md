   - Logs and temporary files
   - Build artifacts (artifacts/, outputs/)

2. **`.env.template`** - Environment variable template with:
   - OpenAI API configuration
   - Notion integration settings
   - Zotero API settings
   - Project-specific settings
   - Clear documentation for each variable

3. **`.pre-commit-config.yaml`** - Code quality hooks:
   - File checks (trailing whitespace, large files, secrets)
   - Python formatting (black, flake8)
   - Markdown formatting (mdformat)
   - Secret detection (detect-secrets)

4. **`.secrets.baseline`** - Baseline for secret detection

5. **`requirements.txt`** - Consolidated Python dependencies:
   - Core: openai, requests, python-dotenv
   - Document processing: python-docx, pdfminer.six
   - Data analysis: pandas, openpyxl
   - Development: pre-commit, black, flake8, pylint
   - Optional: notion-client, pyzotero

6. **`setup.sh`** - Automated setup script that:
   - Checks Python installation
   - Creates virtual environment
   - Installs dependencies
   - Creates .env file
   - Installs pre-commit hooks
   - Provides next steps

7. **`.github/workflows/setup-validation.yml`** - CI workflow for:
   - Installing dependencies

   - Validating Python scripts
   - Checking directory structure
   - Testing connection validation

### Scripts (1 new file)

1. **`scripts/validate_connections.py`** - API connection tester:
   - Tests OpenAI, Notion, and Zotero APIs

   - Next immediate steps
   - Updated timestamp

### Directory Structure (with READMEs)

Created the following directories with documentation:

- `logs/` - Application logs (with README.md)
- `artifacts/` - Generated outputs (with README.md)
- `docs/prompts/` - AI prompt templates (with README.md)
- `docs/outputs/` - AI-generated archives
- `docs/audit-notes/` - Security logs

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review
- ✅ Addressed all code review comments
- Fixed setup.sh to reference correct validation command
- Fixed validate_connections.py datetime consistency issue

### Security Scan (CodeQL)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities found
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow to use explicit permissions
- All Python scripts validated

### Testing
- ✅ Setup script tested successfully
- ✅ Connection validation script works correctly
- ✅ All required files and directories verified
- ✅ Python scripts compile without errors

## Key Features

1. **One-command Setup**: `./setup.sh` handles entire environment setup
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Multiple guides for different use cases
3. **Code Quality Enforcement**: Pre-commit hooks for consistent code style
4. **Security Best Practices**: Secret detection, .gitignore, .env.template
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated validation workflow
6. **API Testing**: Built-in connection validation for all integrations

## For End Users

### To Get Started:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SfosssHousing/HousingPolicyResearch.git
cd HousingPolicyResearch

# Run setup
./setup.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Validate connections
python scripts/validate_connections.py
```

### Next Steps for Repository Maintainers:

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**: Add API keys to repository secrets:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `NOTION_API_KEY`
   - `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`
   - `ZOTERO_API_KEY`
   - `ZOTERO_LIBRARY_ID`

2. **Test on Clean Environment**: Have a team member test the setup from scratch

3. **Update Integration Scripts**: Ensure existing scripts use the new structure

4. **Populate Prompts Library**: Add standard prompts to `docs/prompts/`
