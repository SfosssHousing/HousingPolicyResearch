# Housing Policy Research Workspace

This repository contains a ready‑to‑use scaffold for housing policy research and
analysis. It pulls together a set of sensible defaults for version control,
Quarto document templates, automation hooks and a Raycast extension to
streamline common tasks (adding sources, generating drafts and sweeping
legislation). The directory structure mirrors the one described in the
recommendation and can be safely synced to iCloud or another cloud service for
easy access on macOS and iOS devices.
