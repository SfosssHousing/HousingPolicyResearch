## Title

**A Local Law**

In relation to [describe the principal subject of the bill].  The title
should be a single sentence that clearly identifies the subject of the bill.  It
should avoid technical jargon and should not include parentheses or numbered
sections.

## Enacting Clause

<u>Be it enacted by the Council as follows:</u>

*(According to the City’s bill drafting manual, every bill must begin with
this statement.  The phrase “Be it enacted by the Council as follows,” along
with the colon, should be underlined and followed by a paragraph break【847248757977671†L88-L100】.)*

## Section 1. Legislative Findings and Intent

Provide a brief statement of legislative findings and the purpose of the bill.
If definitions are required, include them here.  Use present tense verbs to
define terms (e.g., “The term *housing voucher* **means** a payment from the
city …”) rather than “shall mean”【847248757977671†L117-L121】.  Define each term only once and
use the term consistently throughout the bill.

## Section 2. Substantive Provisions

Set forth the operative language of your bill.  If you are amending the
administrative code, identify the chapter and section to be amended and show
the language to be added or deleted (e.g., new text is **underlined** and
deleted text is *stricken*).  For new sections, provide the full text.  Use
clear, unambiguous language and the active voice where possible【847248757977671†L72-L79】.

## Section 3. Effective Date

Specify when the law takes effect.  The bill drafting manual recommends
using “takes effect” rather than “shall take effect,” and “after it becomes
law” rather than “after its enactment”【847248757977671†L104-L110】.  For example:

> This local law takes effect 120 days after it becomes law, except that the
> commissioner of [agency] may promulgate rules necessary to implement this
> local law before such date.

## Notes

- **Clarity:** Use plain language and avoid acronyms.  If you must use an
  acronym, define it on first use and include a definition section if needed.
- **Consistency:** Use terms consistently (e.g., if you define “housing
  subsidy,” use the same term throughout the bill)【847248757977671†L117-L121】.
- **References to other laws:** When referring to state or federal law, follow
  the manual’s conventions (e.g., refer to “the New York codes, rules and
  regulations” rather than “NYCRR”)【847248757977671†L145-L153】.
- **Effective date:** Avoid phrases like “shall take effect.”  Use the present
  tense (“takes effect”)【847248757977671†L104-L110】.
- **Definitions:** Use “means” instead of “shall mean” when defining terms【847248757977671†L117-L121】.
- **Enacting clause:** Underline both the phrase and the colon in the enacting
  clause【847248757977671†L88-L100】.
