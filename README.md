# Housing Policy Research

This repository hosts documentation and tooling for collaborative research on housing policy. Use the resources below to set up a secure, reproducible environment and coordinate work across supporting platforms.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and create a local development environment (see [Environment Setup](docs/environment-setup.md)).
1. Review the [Project Roadmap](docs/project-roadmap.md) for outstanding tasks.
1. Use GitHub issues to track progress and link commits to roadmap items.

## Tooling Overview

| Tool            | Purpose                                                          | Notes                                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChatGPT / Codex | Draft analytical memos, code snippets, and summaries.            | Secure API keys via environment variables or GitHub secrets.              |
| Notion          | Organize meeting notes, project plans, and shared knowledge.     | Configure a private integration and restrict shared pages.                |
| GitHub          | Version control for documentation, data scripts, and automation. | Enable branch protection and use pull requests for review.                |
| Zotero          | Manage research references and citations.                        | Maintain a dedicated group library and export bibliographies to the repo. |

## Security Practices

- Do not commit API keys or credentials to the repository.
- Store sensitive configuration values in a password manager or as GitHub Actions secrets.
- Rotate integration tokens (OpenAI, Notion, Zotero) on a regular cadence.

> **Note:** Some directories are placeholders that will be populated as the integrations described in the documentation are implemented.

1. Create a branch for your change.
1. Make updates and add tests or documentation as needed.
1. Run any relevant checks locally (linting, formatting, unit tests).
1. Submit a pull request referencing the related roadmap tasks or issues.

## Support

If you encounter configuration issues or discover missing documentation, open a GitHub issue with detailed context so the team can respond quickly.
This repository centralizes documentation, tooling plans, and integration guidelines for the Housing Policy Research project.

## Documentation

- [Environment Integrations and Documentation](docs/environment-integrations.md): describes the end-to-end setup for secure, bidirectional connections between ChatGPT, Codex automations, Notion, GitHub, and Zotero, and outlines follow-up tasks for the project workspace.
- [Workspace Readiness and Outstanding Setup](docs/workspace-readiness.md): actionable checklist for finishing the Raycast extension build, Quarto/APA installation, secrets configuration, and shortcut automation.
- `SECURITY.md`: organization-wide security policies.

1. Run the automated setup script (creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies):

```

1. Review the [Environment Integration and Documentation Plan](docs/integration-plan.md) for platform-specific setup steps.
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add the required secrets for ChatGPT, Codex, Notion, GitHub, and Zotero.
1. Install the Codex CLI (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add the required secrets for OpenAI, Notion, GitHub, and Zotero.
1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
1. Validate third-party connections (requires configured environment variables):
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_connections.py
   ```
1. Use GitHub Issues or Projects to track automation scripts and data synchronization tasks described in the plan.
1. For native/web clients, follow the [Universal Linking Guide](docs/universal-linking-guide.md) to keep deep links aligned with repository content.

## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

For additional context on automation scripts, secret management, and cross-platform workflows, see [docs/integration-plan.md](docs/integration-plan.md) and the capstone notes in [`capstone/`](capstone/README.md).

## Resources and Citations

The project maintains a rigorous research database with APA-style citations:

- **[Resources Index](docs/resources-index.md)** – Comprehensive catalog of all research sources, technical documentation, and datasets with annotations
- **[Resources CSV](docs/resources.csv)** – Machine-readable database for automated bibliography generation and cross-referencing
- **[APA Style Guide](docs/STYLE-APA.md)** – House citation standards based on APA 7th edition, tailored for housing policy research
- **[Generative Output Tracking](docs/generative-output-version-control.md)** – Version control and verification system for AI-generated documentation

When citing sources in project documentation, refer to the [APA Style Guide](docs/STYLE-APA.md) for formatting requirements. All new resources should be added to both the [Resources Index](docs/resources-index.md) and [Resources CSV](docs/resources.csv).
