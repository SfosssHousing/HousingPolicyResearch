## II. STATEMENT OF NEED

### A. Current System Deficiencies

New York City allocates over $5 billion annually across multiple rental assistance programs, including CityFHEPS ($1.1B in FY2025), Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (administered by NYCHA and HPD, ~$2.5B), and other targeted subsidy programs (~$1.4B).¹ ² Despite this substantial public investment, these programs fail to address fundamental wealth disparities because they:

1. **Provide temporary consumption support** rather than permanent asset-building opportunities
1. **Transfer public funds to landlords** as rental income without tenant equity accumulation
1. **Perpetuate racial wealth gaps** by maintaining differential access to property ownership
1. **Generate unsustainable downstream costs** through eviction response ($15,000/household) and shelter system utilization ($45,000 city share annually per family)³ ⁴

### B. Racial Homeownership Disparities

Current homeownership rates in New York City (2021-2022 data) demonstrate persistent racial stratification:⁵

- White households: 44%
- Asian households: 34%
- Black households: 27% (17-point gap below White)
- Latino households: 17% (27-point gap below White)

These disparities reflect historical redlining, predatory lending practices, and systematic exclusion from mortgage markets rather than individual household characteristics. Multivariate analyses controlling for income, education, immigration status, and household composition find that racial disparities persist, indicating structural barriers requiring policy intervention.⁶

### C. Housing Stability Crisis

The city's housing instability metrics demonstrate urgent need for intervention:

- **895,457 housing code violations** issued in FY2024, representing 24% year-over-year increase⁷
- **100,000+ individuals** in shelter system (record high)⁸
- **10-15% annual eviction filing rate** in buildings with high subsidy concentration⁹
- **53% voucher lease-up rate**, indicating widespread difficulty securing housing even with assistance¹⁰

### D. Fiscal Unsustainability

Current rental assistance programs generate escalating costs without long-term resolution:

- CityFHEPS costs quadrupled from $155M (FY2020) to $819M (FY2024) and projected to exceed $1.1B in FY2025¹
- Five-year comparative analysis demonstrates CityFHEPS costs city 27% more than shelter for single adults and 64% more for families when accounting for recurring vs. episodic expenditures¹
- Emergency shelter system ($99,000/year total cost per family, $45,000 city share) remains most expensive intervention⁴

## III. PROPOSED SOLUTION: TCAP FRAMEWORK

### A. Program Overview

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program (TCAP) redirects existing rental subsidies from consumption payments to equity-building instruments, enabling organized tenant associations to acquire collective ownership of their buildings through subsidized limited-equity housing cooperatives.

**Core Mechanism:**

1. Tenant associations in eligible properties (40%+ subsidy concentration, documented code violations, organized tenant capacity) apply for certification
1. Upon certification, properties become eligible for acquisition financing through city-capitalized Tenant Opportunity Fund
1. Rental subsidies phase into equity allocation over 5 years:
   - Years 1-2: 50% equity/reserves, 50% carrying charges
   - Years 3-4: 65% equity/reserves, 35% carrying charges
   - Year 5+: 75% equity/reserves, 25% carrying charges
1. Cooperatives operate under 30+ year affordability covenants with democratic governance and city oversight

- Emergency reserves: financial security during hardship

### B. Racial Equity Impact

**Current Homeownership Gap (2021-2022):**

- Black households: 17 points below White households
- Latino households: 27 points below White households

**TCAP Projected Impact (10 Years):**

- 2,000 new Black and Latino cooperative member-owners

- 12-15% progress toward full gap closure
- Model for continued expansion addressing structural barriers

**Intergenerational Effects:**

- Children in stable cooperative housing show improved educational outcomes¹³
- Reduced displacement trauma and school mobility¹⁴
- Accumulated wealth transferable to next generation
- Community organizing capacity building with lasting effects

### C. Housing Stability Metrics

**Eviction Reduction:**

- Baseline eviction filing rate: 10-15% annually in comparable properties
- TCAP projected rate: 2-4% annually by Year 5
- Reduction: 60-75% fewer evictions
- Mechanism: Elimination of landlord-initiated evictions, cooperative governance addresses payment issues through member support rather than legal action

**Residential Tenure:**

- Baseline average tenure: 3-5 years
- TCAP projected tenure: 12-15+ years
- Result: Dramatic reduction in displacement, improved neighborhood stability

**Housing Cost Burden:**

- Baseline: 50-60% of income on housing costs
- TCAP Year 5: 25-35% of income on housing costs
- Mechanism: Phased subsidy reduction + elimination of profit-seeking rent increases

### D. Neighborhood Stabilization

**Community Benefits:**

- 20+ buildings stabilized through cooperative ownership by Year 10
- 2,000+ households protected from displacement and gentrification

______________________________________________________________________

## VI. LEGAL FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS

### A. Municipal Authority

**NYC Charter Authority:**

- Article VI (Department of Housing Preservation and Development) grants HPD authority to "formulate and execute plans, policies and regulations for the maintenance, improvement and development of housing" (Charter § 1802)
- Administrative Code Title 26 provides comprehensive framework for housing regulation
- City Council legislative authority under Charter Article III to enact local laws addressing housing conditions and tenant welfare

**Precedent:**

- HDFC cooperative regulatory framework (since 1970s) demonstrates municipal capacity
- Third Party Transfer program (1996-2018) precedent for tenant acquisition facilitation
- Mitchell-Lama program regulatory oversight model

### B. State Law Coordination

**NYS Cooperative Corporations Law:**

- Article 2 provides comprehensive legal framework for housing cooperatives
- Permits limited-equity restrictions and resale formulas (§ 31)
- Authorizes municipal oversight and regulation
- Requires Attorney General review of offering plans (GBL Article 23-A)

**NYS Real Property Law:**

- Permits deed restrictions and affordability covenants
- Authorizes land use controls for affordable housing preservation
- Supports subsidy recapture mechanisms

**Required State Actions:**

- NYS Division of HCR coordination for cooperative oversight
- Attorney General guidance on offering plan exemptions or streamlined review
- Potential statutory clarification for subsidy conversion authorization (legislative request)

### C. Federal Law Compliance

**HUD Requirements:**

- Housing Choice Voucher program regulations (24 CFR Part 982) require portability and housing quality standards but do not prohibit cooperative ownership
- Moving to Work designation or demonstration project status provides administrative flexibility for subsidy use innovation
- CDBG regulations (24 CFR Part 570) permit acquisition financing for affordable housing

**Required Federal Actions:**

- HUD waiver or demonstration project approval for voucher program integration
- CDBG allocation coordination with regional HUD office
- Fair Housing Act compliance verification (cooperative admission policies)

### D. Constitutional Considerations

**Takings Clause Analysis:**

- Property owners retain right to sell at market rates
- Tenant matching rights analogous to right of first refusal (upheld in numerous jurisdictions)
- 90-day notice period provides reasonable accommodation
- No mandatory sale requirement

**Equal Protection:**

- Race-neutral eligibility criteria based on income and subsidy receipt
- Geographic diversity requirements prevent discriminatory concentration
- Benefits targeted to remedy documented historical discrimination (compelling interest)

**Due Process:**

- Administrative procedures provide notice and opportunity to be heard
- Judicial review available for adverse decisions
- Clear standards in statute and regulations

______________________________________________________________________

## X. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

### Summary of Findings

The Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program represents a **fiscally responsible, legally feasible, and socially transformative** intervention in New York City's housing crisis. Through systematic redirection of existing rental subsidy expenditures into collective ownership structures, TCAP achieves multiple policy objectives simultaneously:

**Fiscal Responsibility:**

- 2.9:1 return on public investment with conservative assumptions
- $374.5M net benefit over 10 years
- Break-even in Year 9, then sustained annual savings
- Revolving loan fund sustainability through repayments

**Wealth Building:**

- $64M in permanent household assets created
- 4-6 percentage point reduction in racial homeownership gap
- Intergenerational wealth transfer enabling economic mobility
- Structural intervention addressing historical exclusion

**Housing Stability:**

- 60-75% reduction in eviction rates
- 3-5x increase in residential tenure
- Improved building maintenance through aligned ownership incentives
- Neighborhood stabilization and displacement prevention

**Policy Innovation:**

- Transforms rental subsidies from consumption to investment
- Creates replicable national model
- Builds upon proven precedents (DC TOPA, NYC HDFCs)
- Positions NYC as leader in equitable housing policy

### Legislative Recommendation

**The New York City Council should:**

1. **Introduce and pass** the four companion bills establishing TCAP during the current legislative session

1. **Appropriate $40 million** in capital funds for Tenant Opportunity Fund initial capitalization (FY2026)

1. **Commit $3.4 million annually** in expense budget for TCAP Implementation Unit operations

1. **Authorize HPD** to pursue federal waivers, state coordination, and interagency agreements necessary for implementation

1. **Mandate annual reporting** to Council on program performance, outcomes, and scaling recommendations

1. **Establish oversight** through Committee on Housing and Buildings with at least one hearing annually

### Call to Action

The convergence of fiscal pressure, housing crisis, and political opportunity creates an imperative for transformative action. Traditional rental assistance programs, while providing essential short-term housing stability, fail to address wealth inequality and perpetuate landlord-centric housing models. TCAP offers a viable alternative that honors both fiscal responsibility and racial equity imperatives.

**The time for incremental reform has passed. The moment for structural transformation is now.**
