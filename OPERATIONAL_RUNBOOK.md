### When to Use
- **Frequency:** Weekly (recommended Mondays)
- **Time Required:** 5 minutes
- **Output:** CSV file with bill data
- **Integration:** Feeds into policy memo drafting

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Open Raycast
```
Keyboard: Cmd + Space
Result: Raycast search bar opens
```

#### Step 2: Search for Command
```
Type: "Sweep Bills"
Result: "Sweep Bills" command appears
Click: Select the command
```

#### Step 3: Select Jurisdictions
```
You see three checkboxes:
  ✓ NYC
  ✓ New York State  
  ☐ Federal (optional)

Action: Check NYC and NY State (required minimum)
Note: Federal optional for broader context
```

#### Step 4: Set Date Range
```
You see: "Search Since (Optional)" date picker
Action: Click date picker
Select: 7 days ago (for weekly sweeps)
Example: If today is Jan 13, select Jan 6
Note: Leave empty to search all bills
```

#### Step 5: Execute
```
Action: Click "Sweep Bills" button
Status: Loading indicator appears
Wait: 5-30 seconds for results
```

#### Step 6: Review Results
```
You see: Detail view with formatted results
Show: 
  - Bill title
  - Jurisdiction (NYC, NY, Federal)
  - Status (In Committee, Passed, Enacted, etc.)
  - Last action date
  - Summary (if available)
  - URL (if available)

Action: Scroll through all bills
Note: Copy relevant bills for your research
```

#### Step 7: Export to CSV
```
Raycast outputs: bills_sweep_YYYYMMDD.csv
Location: ~/Documents/GitHub/HousingPolicyResearch/data/bills/

Columns:
  - title: Bill name
  - jurisdiction: NYC, NY, or Federal
  - status: Current legislative status
  - last_action: Most recent action date
  - url: Link to bill text (if available)
  - policy_area: Tagged as "housing_subsidy"
  - priority: Manual assignment after review
  - notes: Your analysis notes
```

#### Step 8: Add to Notion Database
```
Action: Open Notion Housing Bills table
Import: Paste bill data from CSV
Tag: By jurisdiction and policy relevance
Priority: Set HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on impact
Notes: Add 1-2 sentence policy summary

Example:
Title: "Housing Preservation Act 2025"
Jurisdiction: NY State
Status: In Committee
Priority: HIGH
Notes: "Increases subsidized housing funding by 12%; could affect TCAP model assumptions"
```

#### Step 9: Close Raycast
```
Keyboard: Esc
Result: Raycast closes
Next: Proceed to research or memo drafting
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Command not found in search  
**Solution:** Ensure extension is loaded (Cmd + Shift + A → "Load Extension" → Select directory)

**Problem:** "Network error. Check your connection and backend URL."  
**Solution:** Verify backend API is running and URL is correct in Raycast preferences (Cmd + ,)

**Problem:** Results show "No new bills found."  
**Solution:** Normal if search period is short; try extending date range or try Federal jurisdiction

**Problem:** Results are loading slowly  
**Solution:** Backend may be under load; wait 30+ seconds or try again later

### Example Output

```
- **Housing Preservation Act 2025** (`NY State`)
  - Status: In Committee
  - Last Action: 2025-01-05
  - Summary: Increases funding for subsidized housing programs

- **Rental Assistance Expansion** (`NYC`)
  - Status: Passed Committee
  - Last Action: 2025-01-10
  - Summary: Expands emergency rental assistance in Bronx and Brooklyn

  - Status: In Discussion
  - Last Action: 2025-01-08
  - Summary: Proposes changes to Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program
```

## 2. GENERATE DRAFT SECTION (Policy Memo Writing)

### Purpose
Generate AI-assisted draft policy memo sections to accelerate policy document creation.

### When to Use
- **Frequency:** As needed (3-5 times per memo)
- **Time Required:** 5 minutes per section
- **Output:** Markdown text with drafted content
- **Integration:** Copy-paste into policy memo document

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Open Raycast
```
Keyboard: Cmd + Space
Result: Raycast search bar opens
```

#### Step 2: Search for Command
```
Type: "Generate Draft"
Result: "Generate Draft Section" command appears
Click: Select the command
```

#### Step 3: Enter Section Name
```
You see: "Section Name" text field

Common sections:
  - Executive Summary
  - Introduction
  - Key Findings
  - Analysis
  - Recommendations
  - Implementation Roadmap
  - Conclusion

Action: Type your section name
Example: "Key Findings"
```

#### Step 4: Write Your Prompt
```
You see: "Prompt" text area

Prompt structure:
1. What to write (e.g., "Summarize housing subsidy reform findings")
2. Context (e.g., "Based on NYC housing policy analysis 2024-2025")
3. Constraints (e.g., "Target: 500 words, professional tone")
4. Special instructions (e.g., "Focus on equity outcomes")

Example prompt:
"Summarize the key findings from our analysis of NYC housing subsidy programs.
 Focus on:
1. ROI implications of Public Equity Transfer Framework
2. Equity impact on low-income renters
3. Fiscal implications for NYC budget
Target: 400-500 words, professional tone, cite data where available."

Action: Type your detailed prompt
Note: More specific = better output
```

#### Step 5: Submit Request
```
Action: Click "Generate Draft" button
Status: Loading indicator with progress
Wait: 10-60 seconds depending on prompt complexity
```

#### Step 6: Review Generated Content
```
You see: Detail view with generated markdown

Content includes:
  - Formatted section heading
  - Generated paragraph text
  - Metadata (tokens used, model, timestamp)
  - Ready for copy-paste

Review for:
  ✓ Accuracy and relevance
  ✓ Proper structure and formatting
  ✓ Appropriate tone and language
  ☐ Any factual errors or gaps
  ☐ Missing citations or references

Note: AI output is DRAFT ONLY - human review required
```

#### Step 7: Copy to Memo Document
```
Action: Copy generated text (Cmd + C)
Open: Your policy memo document in Word/Google Docs/Markdown editor
Paste: Content into appropriate section
Edit: Refine wording, add citations, adjust as needed
```

#### Step 8: Manual Refinement
```
Tasks:
1. Verify all claims and statistics
2. Add missing citations
3. Adjust tone and language as needed
4. Integrate with surrounding sections
5. Check formatting consistency
6. Flag any questions for further research

Example edit:
Before (AI): "Housing subsidies help low-income residents."
After (You): "The Public Equity Transfer Framework, as described in our analysis,
             could increase owner wealth among low-income NYC households by
             average of $50,000 per unit over 20 years, addressing racial
             wealth gaps documented in Smith et al. (2024)."
```

#### Step 9: Generate Next Section (Repeat)
```
Raycast: Cmd + Space → "Generate Draft" → New section name → New prompt → Execute
Note: You can generate multiple sections in sequence
```

### Tips for Better Output

**DO:**
- ✓ Provide specific context (e.g., "based on NYC housing data 2024")
- ✓ Include constraints (word count, tone, format)
- ✓ Mention key points to cover
- ✓ Request structured output (bullet points, sections, etc.)
- ✓ Reference your research sources

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Use vague prompts ("write about housing")
- ✗ Expect perfectly accurate citations
- ✗ Skip human review of output
- ✗ Use AI text without refinement
- ✗ Trust numbers without verification

### Example Workflow

```
1. Generate "Executive Summary"
   Prompt: "Provide 200-word executive summary of NYC housing subsidy
           reform analysis, emphasizing ROI and equity outcomes"
   Output: 250 words of AI-generated summary

2. Edit manually
   - Verify statistics
   - Add missing citations
   - Adjust phrasing
   - Time: 10 minutes

3. Generate "Key Findings"
   Prompt: "Summarize 5 key findings from our analysis:
           1. Subsidy efficiency gaps
           2. Equity impacts
           3. Fiscal implications
           4. Recommendation framework
           5. Implementation timeline
           Use bullet points, 50-75 words per finding"
   Output: 350 words of structured findings

4. Edit and integrate
   - Match section formatting
   - Add references
   - Connect to recommendations
   - Time: 15 minutes

5. Repeat for Recommendations and Conclusion

Total time: ~2 hours for complete memo with AI assistance
(vs. 6+ hours manual writing)
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** "Please specify a section name"  
**Solution:** Click back and enter section name (required field)

**Problem:** "Please provide a prompt for the draft"  
**Solution:** Click back and enter detailed prompt (required field)

**Problem:** Generated content is irrelevant or inaccurate  
**Solution:** Refine your prompt with more specific context and constraints

**Problem:** Output is too short or too long  
**Solution:** Add word count targets in prompt (e.g., "Target: 400-500 words")

**Problem:** Tone doesn't match your policy memo style  
**Solution:** Add tone instruction in prompt (e.g., "professional, academic tone")
