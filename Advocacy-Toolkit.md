# SECTION 1: TENANT ORGANIZING TOOLS

## 1.1 BUILDING POWER: TENANT ASSOCIATION FORMATION

### Why Organize?

**Collective power is essential for:**
- Holding landlords accountable
- Accessing TCAP and cooperative ownership
- Building community resilience
- Protecting tenant rights
- Creating long-term housing stability

### Step-by-Step Organizing Guide

**STEP 1: IDENTIFY CORE ORGANIZERS (Weeks 1-2)**

**Activities:**
- Identify 3-5 trusted tenants willing to take leadership
- Assess building conditions and tenant concerns
- Conduct informal conversations with neighbors
- Map out which tenants might be allies

**Questions to Answer:**
- Who are the natural leaders in the building?
- What are the top 3 issues affecting tenants?
- Are there language or accessibility barriers to address?
- What is the building's organizing history?

**Tools Needed:**
- Tenant roster (if available)
- Building layout map
- Issue survey (informal)

---

**STEP 2: BUILD RELATIONSHIPS (Weeks 3-6)**

**Activities:**
- Door-knock every unit multiple times
- Host informal gatherings (potlucks, building events)
- Create communication channels (WhatsApp group, email list)
- Listen deeply to tenant concerns
- Identify shared grievances

**Organizing Principle:** **"People organize around their own issues, not yours."**

**Sample Door-Knock Script:**

> "Hi, I'm [Name] from Apartment [#]. I've been living here for [X] years. I'm talking to neighbors because I've noticed [issue - e.g., heat problems, leaks, roaches]. Have you experienced this too? I'm thinking we could work together to fix these problems. Would you be interested in coming to a building meeting next week?"

**Follow-Up:**
- Get contact information (phone, email, preferred language)
- Invite to first building meeting
- Follow up with text or call reminder

---

**STEP 3: HOLD FIRST BUILDING MEETING (Week 7)**

**Preparation:**
- Choose accessible location (community room, local church, park)
- Provide childcare if possible
- Prepare food (builds community!)
- Translate materials into building languages
- Invite supportive partner organizations

**Meeting Agenda (90 minutes):**

**Welcome & Introductions (15 min)**
- Go around room: Name, apartment, one hope for the building
- Establish ground rules (respect, confidentiality, one mic)

**Share Stories (30 min)**
- "What brought you here today?"
- Collective storytelling about building conditions
- Identify common themes

**Vision & Goals (20 min)**
- "What would a healthy, safe building look like?"
- Brainstorm priorities
- Dot-vote on top 3 issues

**Next Steps & Structure (20 min)**
- Discuss forming a tenant association
- Elect interim leadership or steering committee
- Set next meeting date
- Form working groups (communications, research, actions)

**Closing (5 min)**
- Collective commitment: "Will you come to the next meeting?"
- Celebratory moment (chant, song, clapping)

**Post-Meeting:**
- Send thank-you texts to all attendees
- Share meeting notes
- Follow up with people who couldn't attend

---

**Option B: Incorporated Nonprofit (More Formal)**
- File Articles of Incorporation with NYS
- Obtain 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) status (if seeking tax exemption)
- More paperwork but greater legal protections

**Essential Documents:**
□ Bylaws (adapt model bylaws provided below)  
□ EIN (apply at irs.gov)

---

**STEP 5: TAKE ACTION AND BUILD MOMENTUM (Ongoing)**

**Early Wins Strategy:**

Choose campaigns that are:
- **Winnable** (realistic to achieve)
- **Widely felt** (affects many tenants)
- **Build capacity** (strengthen organization)

**Escalation Tactics (from least to most intensive):**

1. **Petition** → Gather signatures demanding repairs
2. **Delegation** → Meet with landlord or HPD
3. **Public pressure** → Media, social media, community board
4. **Rally/demonstration** → Visible public action
5. **Rent strike** → Withhold rent (last resort, legal risks)
6. **TCAP application** → Pursue cooperative ownership

**Sustaining Momentum:**
- Celebrate victories (no matter how small!)
- Share leadership responsibilities
- Keep members informed and engaged
- Address conflicts early
- Connect to broader housing justice movement

# SECTION 2: EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES

## 2.1 TCAP 101: OVERVIEW FOR TENANTS

### What is TCAP?

**TCAP (Tenant Co-op Acquisition Program)** is a New York City program that helps tenants buy their buildings and become collective owners through **limited-equity cooperatives**.

Instead of paying rent to a landlord who may neglect the building, your rent subsidy (Section 8, CityFHEPS, HASA) helps you buy **shares** in your building. You become a **member-owner** with a voice in how the building is run.

### How Does It Work?

**Step 1:** Tenants organize and form a tenant association  
**Step 2:** Association gets certified by HPD  
**Step 3:** Building is evaluated for eligibility  
**Step 4:** Subsidies are converted to equity contributions  
**Step 5:** Association gets financing to purchase building  
**Step 6:** Cooperative is formed and tenants become owners  
**Step 7:** Ongoing support and oversight from HPD

### What's a Limited-Equity Cooperative?

**Cooperative =** Residents own the building together as a corporation. You own **shares**, not your individual apartment.

**Limited-Equity =** When you sell your shares, you can't charge any price you want. Resale prices are **capped** to keep apartments affordable for future low-income families.

**Benefits:**
✅ Build wealth through equity accumulation  
✅ Democratic control (you elect the board)  
✅ Stability (no landlord can sell building under you)  
✅ Better maintained (you control repairs)  
✅ Community ownership  

**Trade-offs:**
⚠️ Responsibilities (you help run the building)  
⚠️ Limited resale profit (to preserve affordability)  
⚠️ Requires participation and governance  

### Who Is Eligible?

**Buildings:**
- 40%+ of tenants have subsidies
- History of neglect or code violations
- Financially feasible to convert

**Tenants:**
- Receiving housing subsidies (Section 8, CityFHEPS, HASA)
- Income at or below 80% Area Median Income
- Willing to participate in cooperative governance

### What Will It Cost?

**During Conversion:** Your out-of-pocket costs should NOT increase. Your subsidy is redirected, not reduced.

**After Conversion:** You'll pay "carrying charges" (like rent, but you're an owner). This covers:
- Building maintenance and repairs
- Property taxes
- Utilities (if included)
- Reserve fund contributions
- Staff (if applicable)

**Your subsidy continues** to help cover these costs based on your income.

### What About Tenants Who Don't Want to Participate?

**You can stay as a renter!** Participation is 100% voluntary. If you don't want to become a co-op member, you can continue renting with your subsidy. You **will not be evicted**.

### How Long Does It Take?

**Typical Timeline:**
- Organizing and certification: 6-12 months
- Financing and acquisition: 12-18 months
- **Total:** 18-30 months from start to ownership

## 2.2 COOPERATIVE HOUSING FUNDAMENTALS

### Types of Housing Ownership

| Type | You Own | Monthly Payment | Can You Sell? | Who Controls? |
|------|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Rental** | Nothing | Rent to landlord | N/A | Landlord |
| **Condo** | Your unit | Common charges + mortgage | Yes, market rate | Condo board (elected) |
| **Market-Rate Co-op** | Shares in corporation | Maintenance + mortgage | Yes, board approval | Co-op board (elected) |
| **Limited-Equity Co-op** | Shares (price capped) | Carrying charges | Yes, with restrictions | Co-op board (elected) |

### How Co-op Governance Works

**General Members (All Residents)**
- Attend meetings
- Vote on major decisions
- Elect board members
- Serve on committees

↓ ELECT ↓

**Board of Directors**
- President, Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary
- Make day-to-day decisions
- Hire management/staff
- Approve budgets
- Set policies

↓ HIRE (if needed) ↓

**Property Manager**
- Collects carrying charges
- Coordinates repairs
- Manages vendors
- Reports to board

### Your Rights and Responsibilities as a Co-op Member

**RIGHTS:**
✅ Vote on major decisions  
✅ Run for board  
✅ Access financial records  
✅ Attend meetings  
✅ Sell your shares (with restrictions)  
✅ Pass shares to family  

**RESPONSIBILITIES:**
✅ Pay carrying charges on time  
✅ Maintain your apartment  
✅ Follow house rules  
✅ Participate in governance  
✅ Respect neighbors and shared spaces  

### Financial Basics

**Income:**
- Carrying charges from members
- Laundry/parking fees (if applicable)
- Converted subsidies
- Commercial rent (if ground-floor stores)

**Expenses:**
- Mortgage/debt service
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- Utilities
- Maintenance and repairs
- Staff salaries (if applicable)
- Management fees
- Reserve contributions

**Reserve Fund =** Savings account for big repairs (roof, boiler, etc.). Should have **minimum $5,000 per unit**.

### Common Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge:** "People don't come to meetings."  
**Solution:** Make meetings accessible, interesting, and empowering. Provide food, childcare, and interpretation. Rotate times. Celebrate wins.

**Challenge:** "The board makes all the decisions."  
**Solution:** Bylaws should require member approval for major decisions (budgets, assessments, major renovations). Term limits prevent entrenchment.

**Challenge:** "We can't afford repairs."  
**Solution:** Build healthy reserve fund. Plan capital improvements in advance. Access city programs for low-interest loans or grants.

**Challenge:** "Some members don't pay on time."  
**Solution:** Clear policies with grace periods and payment plans. Financial assistance fund for hardship cases. Legal remedies as last resort.

## 2.3 FINANCIAL LITERACY MODULES

### Module 1: Understanding Co-op Finances

**Learning Objectives:**
- Read and understand a budget
- Distinguish between operating expenses and capital expenses
- Calculate debt service and reserve needs
- Make informed decisions about finances

**Activity: Budget Breakdown**

[Sample simplified co-op budget with line items explained]

**Practice Questions:**
1. If our property taxes increase by 10%, how will that affect carrying charges?
2. Our boiler needs replacing ($80,000). Do we have enough in reserves?
3. Should we approve this special assessment?

---

### Module 2: Building and Maintaining Reserves

**Why Reserves Matter:**

Without reserves, when something breaks (and it will!), you face:
- Special assessments (emergency fees to all members)
- Taking on debt at high interest rates
- Deferring repairs, leading to bigger problems

**Healthy reserve = financial stability**

**Rule of Thumb:** Reserve fund should equal 50-100% of annual operating budget.

**How to Build Reserves:**
1. Include reserve contributions in monthly carrying charges ($50-100/unit/month)
2. Allocate any surplus at year-end to reserves
3. Apply for grants from city/state programs
4. Refinance debt at lower interest rates, put savings into reserves

**Reserve Study:**
Every 5 years, conduct a "reserve study" - professional assessment of:
- What will need replacement/repair in next 10-20 years
- How much it will cost
- Whether your reserves are adequate

---

### Module 3: Understanding Subsidies and Income Changes

**Subsidy Recertification:**

If you receive a housing subsidy, you must **recertify annually** with:
- Proof of income
- Household composition
- Citizenship/eligible immigration status (for some programs)

**What Happens If My Income Changes?**

**Income goes UP:**
- Your subsidy may decrease or end (based on program rules)
- You may transition to paying full carrying charges
- Limited-equity co-ops have affordability restrictions to keep you housed

**Income goes DOWN:**
- Your subsidy may increase
- You may qualify for additional assistance
- Financial hardship policies may offer payment plans

**Communication is key:** Tell your co-op treasurer and subsidy administrator about changes ASAP.

---

### Module 4: Credit Building and Asset Accumulation

**Cooperative Ownership Builds Wealth:**

Unlike renting, cooperative ownership allows you to:
- **Accumulate equity** in your shares
- **Build credit** (if mortgage payments reported to credit bureaus)
- **Pass assets** to children/family
- **Access home equity** for emergencies (in some co-ops)

**Resale Restrictions Preserve Affordability:**

In a **limited-equity co-op**, when you sell your shares, the resale price is capped. This ensures the next family can also afford to live there.

**Example Formula:**
```
Resale Price = Purchase Price + (Annual Increase × Years Owned)
Annual Increase = 2% OR Area Median Income increase, whichever is less
```

**Example:**
- You bought shares for $20,000
- You lived there 10 years
- Resale price = $20,000 + ($400/year × 10) = $24,000
- You built $4,000 in wealth!

This is modest compared to market-rate appreciation, BUT:
✅ You had stable, affordable housing  
✅ You built wealth instead of paying rent to a landlord  
✅ You helped preserve affordability for the next family  

---

## 2.4 GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRACY TRAINING

### Democratic Decision-Making Models

**Consensus:**
- Goal: Everyone agrees (or can live with decision)
- Process: Discussion until agreement reached
- Pros: Inclusive, builds buy-in
- Cons: Can be slow, vulnerable to blocking

**Majority Vote:**
- Goal: More than 50% support
- Process: Proposals, discussion, vote
- Pros: Efficient, clear outcomes
- Cons: Can create winners/losers, alienate minority

**Supermajority:**
- Goal: 2/3 or 3/4 support for major decisions
- Process: Higher threshold for significant changes
- Pros: Ensures broad support for big decisions
- Cons: Can make change difficult

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
- Routine decisions: Majority vote
- Significant decisions (budgets, assessments, bylaw changes): Supermajority
- Strive for consensus when possible, fall back on voting when needed

---

### Running Effective Board Meetings

**Before Meeting:**
- Prepare agenda
- Distribute materials in advance
- Set date/time at least 7 days ahead

**During Meeting:**
- Follow agenda
- Use consent agendas for routine items (all approved together)
- Focus board time on strategy and policy, not minutiae
- Record minutes with clear action items

**After Meeting:**
- Distribute minutes within 48 hours
- Follow up on action items
- Report to membership

**Executive Sessions:**
Sometimes board needs private discussion (personnel, legal matters). This is okay, but:
- Use sparingly
- Never make decisions in executive session - only discuss, then vote in open session
- Be transparent about why going into executive session

---

### Ethical Leadership

**Conflict of Interest:**

You have a conflict of interest when you (or family) might personally benefit from a co-op decision.

**Examples:**
- You own a business bidding for co-op contract
- Your relative wants to buy a vacant unit
- You're behind on carrying charges and board is discussing payment policies

**What to Do:**
1. **Disclose** the conflict to the board and members
2. **Recuse** yourself from discussion and vote
3. **Document** in meeting minutes

**Never:**
- Vote on matters benefiting you personally
- Use co-op resources for personal gain
- Accept kickbacks from vendors
- Share confidential information for personal benefit

## 3.2 LEGISLATIVE TESTIMONY GUIDE

### Preparing Your Testimony

**Testimony is most effective when it:**
- Tells your personal story
- Connects to the policy issue
- Stays within time limit (usually 2-3 minutes)
- Is specific and fact-based
- Ends with a clear ask

### Structure (for 3-minute testimony)

**OPENING (15 seconds)**
- State your name
- Where you live (district, if relevant)
- Your organizational affiliation (if any)
- Position on the bill ("I support/oppose Int. No. ___")

**BODY (2 minutes)**

**Personal Story (45 seconds):**
"I am a tenant in the Bronx. For 8 years, I've lived without consistent heat in the winter. My landlord ignores our complaints. I organized my neighbors, and together we formed a tenant association. Now, through TCAP, we have the opportunity to buy our building and finally have a safe, stable home."

**Policy Connection (45 seconds):**
"This bill matters because there are thousands of families like mine across the city. We pay rent - often subsidized by taxpayers - but have no control and no path to ownership. TCAP changes that by redirecting subsidies into equity, not landlord profits."

**Evidence/Data (30 seconds):**
"Studies show that homeownership narrows the racial wealth gap, stabilizes communities, and saves the city money in shelter costs. Cities like Washington DC have had similar programs for over 40 years."

**CLOSING (30 seconds)**
- Restate your position
- Make a specific ask
- Thank the committee

**Example:**
"I urge this Council to pass Int. No. ___ and make TCAP a reality. Every family deserves the opportunity we're seeking - to build wealth, stability, and community through homeownership. Thank you for your time."

---

### Tips for Delivering Testimony

**DO:**
✅ Practice out loud multiple times  
✅ Bring written testimony and extra copies  
✅ Speak slowly and clearly  
✅ Make eye contact with Council Members  
✅ Stay calm and professional, even if questioned  
✅ Thank the committee for their time  

**DON'T:**
❌ Go over time limit  
❌ Read in a monotone  
❌ Attack individuals personally  
❌ Use jargon or acronyms without explanation  
❌ Ramble or lose focus
